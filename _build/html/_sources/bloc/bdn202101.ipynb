    "‚ÄúA first, tentative example: at all times morality has aimed to ‚Äúimprove‚Äù men ‚Äî this aim is above all what was called morality. Under the same word, however, the most divergent tendencies have been concealed. But ‚Äúimprovement‚Äù has meant both taming the beast called man, and breeding a particular kind of man. Such zoological concepts are required to express the realities ‚Äî realities of which the typical ‚Äúimprover,‚Äù the priest, admittedly neither knows anything nor wants to know anything.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To call the taming of an animal its ‚Äúimprovement‚Äù sounds almost like a joke to our ears. Whoever knows what goes on in kennels doubts that dogs are ‚Äúimproved‚Äù there. They are weakened, they are made less harmful, and through the depressive effect of fear, through pain, through wounds, and through hunger, they become sickly beasts. It is no different with the tamed man whom the priest has ‚Äúimproved.‚Äù In the early Middle Ages, when the church was indeed, above all, a kennel, the most perfect specimens of the ‚Äúblond beast‚Äù were hunted down everywhere; and the noble Teutons, for example, were ‚Äúimproved.‚Äù But how did such an ‚Äúimproved‚Äù Teuton look after he had been drawn into a monastery? Like a caricature of man, a miscarriage: he had become a ‚Äúsinner,‚Äù he was stuck in a cage, tormented with all sorts of painful concepts. And there he lay, sick, miserable, hateful to himself, full of evil feelings against the impulses of his own life, full of suspicion against all that was still strong and happy. In short, a ‚ÄúChristian.‚Äù  \n",
    "\n",
    "Physiologically speaking: in the struggle with beasts, making them sick may be the only way to make them weak. The church understood this: it sickened and weakened man ‚Äî and by so doing ‚Äúimproved‚Äù him.‚Äù  \n",

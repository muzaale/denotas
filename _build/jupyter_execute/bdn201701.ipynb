    "Was a delight catching up in person after so long! It was also such a pleasure to meet Julius -- congrats on having such a great man for a husband. As for Elaine, it seems like she totally loves music by J.S. Bach. Because it was only in response to a Bach piece I played (not to Mozart, Beethoven, or Chopin) that she got onto her feet, animatedly, to play the piano like a natural-born Maestro :-)  \n",

    "What I will say about sport, I think why people love sport so much, is because you see everything in a line. In that moment there is no do-over, there’s no retake, there is no voice-over. It’s triumph and disaster witnessed in real-time. This is why people live and die for sport, because you can’t fake it. You can’t. It’s either you do it or you don’t.  \n",

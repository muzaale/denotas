    "Like in Molier’s 1670 play Le bourgeois gentilhomme, when Mr. Jourdain is surprised and delighted to learn that he has been speaking prose all his life without knowing it, many scientists such as Richard Feynman and Stephen Hawking are practicing philosophy without knowing. They discourse on ontology (the nature of things), epistemology (the nature of knowledge), identity, change, causality, necessity and the entire range of issues that one might rightly describe as metaphysics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Einstein, in a lecture delivered to the Nordic Assembly of Naturalists at Gothenburg, in lieu of his Nobel Lecture on the photoelectric effect, states the following at the outset:\n",
    "\n",
    "“If we consider that part of the theory of relative which may nowadays in a sense be regarded as bona fide scientific knowledge, we note two aspects which have a major bearing on this theory. The whole development of the theory turns on the question of whether there are physically preferred stats of motion in Nature (physical relativity problem). Also, concepts and distinctions are only admissible to the extent that observable facts cam be assigned to them without ambiguity (stipulation that concepts and distinctions should have meaning). This postulate, pertaining to epistemology, proves to be of fundamental importance.“ (1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The prominent Einstein consciously practiced philosophy, explicitly conducted thought experiments, brought the rigor of metaphysics to bear upon untenable assumptions that had dogged the world of classical physics since the time of Newton, and set off a scientific and technological revolution that is still in its infancy today. Technology is still playing “catchup” with the insights articulated by Einstein between 1905 and 1935. \n",
    "\n",
    "Such dependency between metaphysical concepts and empirical verification is not in any way opposed to Feyman’s conceptualization of the scientific enterprise: postulates, precise predictions, verification (or failure), revision of the postulates, etc. In my final project on the revolution of Organ Transplantation, the “concept” of replacing a failed human organ with a functioning one from an animal, identical twin, full-sibling, parent, or non-biological relative started just as that — a concept. How identical the allograft has to be to the recipient, such as with regard to HLA-DR and immunogenetics, is a matter of metaphysics. Whether such HLA-identity is necessary. Whether such an allograft will survive for a few days or more. Whether the immune rejection of the organ is an ontological fact, or whether it can be changed by immunosuppressive therapy. Whether one can find a donor with identical HLA (i.e., what we now know epistemologically as “neccessary” through tissue typing vs. identical twin in our earlier, more naive epistemology). All these are metaphysical questions the field of transplant grappled with in its early days and still does today. Whether or not transplant professionals are aware they are prating philosophy is one thing. But the fact is that they are. \n",
    "\n",
    "A conscious recognition of this fact may give science the sort of impetus and razor-focus that Einstein had. Maybe the slow progress of science is symptomatic of the neglect of philosophy among prominent modern scientists. We find ourselves “reinventing the wheel“ of metaphysics, unwittingly, like Mr. Jourdain.\n",

    "\"The earth has been a madhouse\", he says in the Genealogy of Morals, and otherworldly philosophers, along with priests, theologians, and others, have played a large a part in making it so. Such claims demand rigorous scrutiny, so it's pleasing that in the book under review Nietzsche's account of ressentiment is carefully investigated and diligently analyzed.  \n",

Fortune is painted blind, with a muffler afore his eyes, to signify to you that Fortune is blind; and she is painted also with a wheel, to signify to you, which is the moral of it, that she is turning, and inconstant, and mutability, and variation; and her foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone, which rolls, and rolls, and rolls. In good truth, the poet makes a most excellent description of it. Fortune is an excellent moral.”  \n",

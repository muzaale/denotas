    "Otherwise, this being the second song of Snarky Puppy that I've listened to (but I already own an entire album), I now have a more informed understanding of who they are.   \n",
    "\n",
    "I think the majority of the instrumentalists don't draw blood at all. In Lingus, that's how I felt, until the keyboardists drew some blood midway. The drummer did too.   \n",
    "\n",
    "As for Shorfukan, it's only the drummer that drew blood. There's something premeditated in the music of the trumpeters and guitarists that is remote from the improvisational spirit of Jazz. This is betrayed by the music scores that many of the group members seem to be reading from.   \n",
    "\n",
    "That's my humble opinion. As a lover of Jazz from New Orleans, I'd expect a lot more -- crazier improvisational riffs -- from the the trumpets. There's a TV show called Tréme, whose sound track and motion picture captures the true soul of New Orléans. Of course, Snarkey Pupply is something modern, something of a blend of genres. But I'll still judge them for the Jazz artists they seem to hold in high regard  \n",

    "Horns are solo instruments best suited for melody (and Wilde riffs). Violins are best suited for harmony (and tame variations on a preordained structure). But it's the double bass -- and piano -- that typically offer the structure.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In jazz, the double bass and piano occasionally go Wilde.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Taking of which, I highly recommend Jon Batiste. He is a native of New Orleans, only 29, but from a famous musical family, which inspired the music on the Tréme TV show. Jon is classically trained also; and at Julliard. He will be the resident musician on the show formerly know as Colbert.  \n",

    "They seem to be young idealists based on the language they use to describe themselves. But I can’t really figure out what they do. Can’t put a finger on something they’ve done. And they throw around the term “growing aggressively” but its not clear to me what number to look out for to measure this growth. Most discouraging is this juvenile info in their mission statement: e.g. `As the great African proverb says “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.”` Only a 20-something kid from New York, who grew up watching Jon Stewart, could write such a meaningless thing and think they are very much knowledgeable about cultures around the world.       \n",

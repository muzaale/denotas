    "Never ones to rush out with new offerings, the brewery of Rochefort now finds it time to roll out a standout beer among their darker regular offering in the style of Tripel Ale. Nearly seventy years in the making, this lighter colored beer still packs that signature Rochefort punch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Triple Extra pours with an elegant weave into the the classic Rochefort chalice while billowing to the brim with a cottony, stark-white froth. As odd as seeing a lighter hued beverage sitting in that glass, the scent is both exciting and unique as a collection of vinous spices, candied fruit, fresh dough and peppery hops drift onto the senses with a radiant but piquant perfume. Sweeter though in its early impressions, those fresh bread flavors lace with impressions of sugar cookie and honeysuckle.\n",
    "\n",
    "As its expressive carbonation pops on the middle palate, the bulk of sweetness is lifted and the higher fruit impressions start to shine. Pear, apple, lemon, orange peel and a hint of grapefruit pull from the ester profile and invite a later balance of peppercorn, white wine and grassy hops to catch up to the level of fruitiness for a dry and even-keel character heading into finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Medium bodied and trending lighter and drier on the finish, the Tripel Ale is a masterful spice-forward and drier example of the style and done so in that classic Trappist Tripel style. Finishing surprisingly refreshing and effortless on the palate for its strength, the ale extends with an afterglow of yeast spice and peppery hops for a hint of lemongrass and white wine to close.\n",

    "Hamlet and Macbeth both portray usurpers as ruling kings, and in each case it is made clear that such rule is not to be tolerated either by the ruled or by the universe. Indeed, the fate of kings is tied to the order of the universe, and dissension and tension in one is reflected in the other. Yet, the issue is complex, and while the usurper has no right to rule, it is not always clear who has the right to prevent him from ruling. In Macbeth, the fate of the usurper is ordained, and his downfall at the hands of the wronged Macduff, who is the rightful king. Macduff has the right to retake his throne by force. The hesitation of Hamlet, much commented on by critics, may derive from the fact that while he knows Claudio to be a regicide, to kill Claudio would make him a regicide as well. In both plays, the usurpation of the throne leads to a more dangerous and uncertain environment in the land, and nature concurs by expressing through storms and other travails visited upon the people that a great political wrong is also a great moral and religious wrong\n",

    "Have you ever read the Theogony? It’s a fairly short book, although a fascinating account of the Greek gods. The Iliad and The Odyssey are epic works. So that’s for starters. I would argue that the Iliad and the Odyssey are also just more interesting, being histories that had it all: war, murder, rape, betrayal, adultery, gods, witches, magic, victory, defeat, misfortune, revenge, vindication—you name it, it’s in the Iliad or the Odyssey. Each of them could make a fine mini-series!\n",

    "\n",
    "It’s also significant that the Homeric epics document a very popular set of stories — the Epic Cycle was epic indeed! Battles at Troy? Enduring heroes struggling to get home? Mythical monsters? Everyone wants to hear about those! Can we really pretend that a blunt list of the 50+ children of ‘Nereus and rich-haired Doris’ is as gripping as Achilles telling Hektor he’d like to hack him up and eat his flesh raw?\n",
    "\n",
    "It hasn’t been studied in the school system (ancient to modern) like the Homeric epics have been; that’s one of the main reasons for the tenacity of Homer’s works — they’ve been very popular for a long time! The Theogony just hasn’t been treated with quite so much affection, over the years… it isn’t as easy to read, nor necessarily as much of a pleasure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Theogony also just isn’t quite as impressive as the Homeric epics. It’s only about 1000 lines, compared to the Odyssey’s ~12,000, or the Iliad’s ~15,000.\n",

    "— Two adjacent theaters; one for the donor and another for the recipient. Only necessary in the case of living donor transplantation, and only if the donor is in the same hospital\n",
    "— Deceased donor transplantation never has such needs as organ harvesting or procurement is performed at the center where the donor was declared brain dead. This site is almost certainly never the same as the recipient center, since there is a waitlist and also HLA-compatibility issues that often lead to the logistical necessity of transporting a procured organ from one center to another \n",

    "— Center should then be invited to (or should itself)) submit the application\n",
    "— It should expect to be granted status unless criteria insufficient \n",
    "— Process should be open to both voting and non-voting members\n",
    "— (6) A hospital seeking to be designated to undertake cadaveric transplantation shall be required to get additional approval. Cadaveric is an out-of-fashion term. We now say Deceased donor transplantation. Also, this statement once again tells us that the unstated assumption is that living donor transplantation is the default mode where no adjective such as deceased donor is used. I believe this makes the bill vague and poorly worded and should be revised in its entirely to make the distinction between living donor and deceased donor transplantation from the outset. \n",

    "— This may be prohibitively expensive. Typically a team of surgeons is sent to harvest the organs at the center where brain-death is declared. Only the organ is transported to the recipient hospital. This is cheaper and more cost-effective\n",

But here they are in error. The atom which they postulate is arrived at by the logic of that perspective of consciousness; it is in itself therefore a subjective fiction. This picture of the world which they project is in no way essentially different from the subjective picture: the only difference is, that it is composed simply with more extended senses, but certainly with our senses.... And in the end, without knowing it, they left something out of the constellation: precisely the necessary perspective factor, by means of which every centre of power—and not man alone—constructs the rest of the world from its point of view—that is to say, measures it, feels it, and moulds it according to its degree of strength.... They forgot to reckon with this perspective-fixing power, in \"true being,\"—or, in school-terms, subject-being. They suppose that this was \"evolved\" and added;—but even the chemical investigator needs it: it is indeed specific Being, which determines action and reaction according to circumstances\n",

    "Turkey has witnessed sustained economic growth during the last ten years, with the country achieving average growth of 5% during 2002-2012, despite the fact that it is surrounded by neighbours facing political or economic crisis, representing a rather unstable external environment. Among its neighbours, Cyprus and Greece were deeply affected by the financial crisis that hit the Euro zone while Syria is being ravaged by civil war, and Iraq is unstable.  The latest demonstrations against the Turkish government’s plan to redevelop Gezi Park turned into nationwide protests, particularly by the youth, and constitute a warning message that the views of the youth of Turkey require serious consideration. An important fact that cannot be overlooked is that the youth movements in the region were the main antecedents for substantial revolutionary changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite the need for caution in assessing Turkey’s economic prospects for the coming years, the country’s success in achieving strong growth so far, amid regional instability, is worth contemplating. In fact, Turkey lacks natural resources such as oil and natural gas that neighboring countries have. However the country generated growth by focusing on enhancing industry, services and tourism, which helped boost its competitiveness. The tourism sector attracted more than 36 million tourists in 2012, rendering Turkey one of the top tourist destinations worldwide. However, this level of growth requires more than reliance on market forces and official development assistance. In order to obtain long-term benefits for growth and poverty alleviation, Turkey engaged in private sector development and structural reforms that enhanced its education and healthcare services, placed stricter controls on public finances and made progress towards combating corruption. Through effective support policies that promote financial resilience, investment, productivity growth and technological change, the country has integrated itself into the global economy and has become one of the major foreign direct investment (FDI) recipients in the Middle East region. (It was rated as the 13th most attractive FDI destination in the world in A.T. Kearney’s FDI Confidence Index 2012).\n",
    "\n",
    "At the macro-level there is a modern infrastructure with highways and railways that link Ankara, the capital, with other parts of the country. To stimulate technological development, the country has been transformed into an important higher education hub that attracts an increasing number of university students from Asia and Africa. Effective university-industry collaboration has contributed to providing domestic industry with its needs in important fields, including aeronautical technology, IT and electronics. The country has invested heavily in technology development zones with 34 operational technoparks and 16 under construction to support research and development activities and attract investment into high technology fields. Turkey has focused on environmental technology aimed at generating sustainable energy that benefits from wind and other renewable energy resources, enabling it to compete globally in innovative green technologies and products. Furthermore, the country has succeeded in solid waste management, turning Ankara into a safer and greener place to live. Methanol gas and organic waste are used to generate electricity and to produce fertilizers for agricultural products, including strawberries, tomatoes and orchids.\n",
    "\n",
    "Turkey’s trade and investment strategy is based upon a strategic ‘opening up’ to emerging markets in Asia and Africa and the Middle East, with low entry barriers. Turkey benefits from a Customs Union agreement with the EU, and free trade agreements with several countries including EFTA ( European Free Trade Association) member countries Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, and also Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Palestine, Syria, and Tunisia. This has contributed to growth and increased productivity in both the industrial and services sectors, including green technology and IT.\n",
    "\n",
    "These achievements would not have been possible without the strong political will of the policy-makers to attain a turnaround in Turkey’s economy and move forward with its EU accession process. They embarked on an incremental process of institutional building and reforms that started in 2003 and aimed at addressing Turkey’s structural problems. The reforms had a positive impact on the banking sector, the management and control of the public budget, and directing domestic investment towards infrastructure, health, education and technology.  In the field of education, concerted efforts by the government and education institutions aim to bridge the gender gap and enhance the quality of education and higher education.\n",
    "\n",
    "A consistent and incremental path of institutional reforms has led to robust economic growth, increased resilience to the global economic crisis and a remarkable surge in exports, reaching $153 billion by the end of 2012, up from $36 billion in 2002.  Most notably, Turkey was registered on the world economic scale as the 16th largest economy in the world, and as 6th largest economy when compared to EU countries in 2012.\n",
    "Turkey’s remarkable achievements show that facing the challenge of enhancing international competitiveness and achieving sustainable growth could be met by combining national support policies for investment, productivity growth, and technological change (based in high value-added sectors) with emerging opportunities in the global economy. That is not to say that Turkey has developed a policy for development that can be replicated everywhere. Any process of reform and private sector development MUST take into account the large differences amongst countries and their individual, unique characteristics. Nevertheless, general policies could be considered – as common features among countries do exist – especially where these can be translated into country-specific policies.\n",

    "\n",
    "With almost 141million followers on TikTok and just over 78 million more on Instagram, Khaby Lame is one of the most followed social media stars in the world. And how has the 22-year-old Italian achieved this? Chiefly through silently satirizing the ridiculous content that other people post in order to become more followed on social media. Now that really is meta.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The funniest part of my content is the silence,” said Lame over WhatsApp yesterday: “Silent comedy speaks a language that everybody in the world can understand.” By doing in the digital age what Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, and Buster Keaton once did during the dawn of cinema, Lame has gone from unemployed factory worker (he started posting after being laid off at the start of the pandemic) to a man who rubs shoulders with global icons like Leo Messi: “Meeting him is one thing I still can’t believe happened.”\n",
    "\n",
    "From 6 pm tonight in San Babila, Milan, Lame will launch his first-ever capsule collection with Boss before throwing a party later at the city’s most famous nightspot, Plastic, so his locally based fans will have the chance to see him IRL. “There will be a giant Khaby,” said Lame. “We will take Polaroid pictures. I will arrive on a scooter flanked by a team of BMX riders wearing the collection. It’ll be amazing!” Doubtless many more will check in via their screens too. Lame says that around 15% of his audience is from Italy, 25 % is from South America, and 30% is from the US*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Boss x Khaby collection is a tight ensemble including varsity jacket and hoodie. One surprising inclusion—and the reason for that ‘giant Khaby’ promised at the reveal later—is a Khaby doll designed to be used as an accessory or an attachment that can be snapped onto the garments. Huh? Lame explained: “When I was a kid I had an action figure of Vegeta from Dragon Ball and I’ve been collecting action figures for years. I’m really passionate about action figures and anime characters. And now to see that there is a doll of myself and there will be an event to launch it along with the collection… I’m super excited.” Lame's capsule will be on sale exclusively in Boss’s San Babila store today before going on global release tomorrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as pumping out content with his team every day, and thinking through his next capsule—“I definitely want to do another one”—Lame is also focused on learning English and plotting his future moves. He said: “I want to be an actor, like Will Smith. He started with comedy, then he made more dramatic movies. He’s done all sorts of films, he’s a great actor and I would like to be like him. In fact my passion for acting started with him, watching him in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Watching that show, I realized that I also wanted to make people laugh.” Lame is certainly doing that on social. And with that 200 million-plus audience already behind him it seems a no-brainer that we’ll see him on bigger screens soon enough.\n",

    "   Sicily is near! It will be an easy victory.”\n",
    "   Cineas thought a moment more. ”And then what shall we do?”\n",
    "   \"Then we will take Libya and Carthage,” the king replied.\n",
    "   \"What will we do after that?”\n",
    "   \"We will secure all of the Greek world under my rule,” the king nodded at the thought.\n",

We've seen Proffessors cut their lives short by simply not living according to God'sWord.\n",

This number is not directly linked to statistical analyses or confidence intervals, but instead, it is a procedural rule set by the Senate.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why 60 votes are needed to end a filibuster is due to Rule XXII of the Senate, often called the \"cloture rule\". This rule was adopted in 1917 in response to the tactics of obstructionists, particularly during debate over America's entry into World War I. Originally, two-thirds of senators present and voting were required to invoke cloture; this was changed to three-fifths of all senators (normally 60 out of 100) in a 1975 amendment to the rule.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, the 60 vote rule means that, while a simple majority (51 votes) is required to pass most legislation, a supermajority (60 votes) is required to end debate and bring the legislation to a vote. This gives substantial power to minority factions within the Senate, as they can block legislation unless a compromise can be reached that convinces enough senators to invoke cloture.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While it's an interesting observation that the upper range of a 95% confidence interval around a slim majority (0.51) in a 100-member Senate is near 60, it's likely coincidental and not the direct reasoning behind the procedural rule. The rule is more about facilitating debate and requiring a larger consensus to move forward with legislation.    \n",

    "\n",
    "A systematic review and meta-analysis of 5087 randomized, controlled trials published in general medical journals was conducted by a meticulous defender of science, Carlisle JB, in 2017 (1). Carlislse found data fabrication and other reasons for non-random sampling in several of these studies, including Estruch et al for the PREDIMED Study Investigators. Primary prevention of cardiovascular disease with a Mediterranean diet. NEJM 2013 (2). This latter study is my choice for Part A of this weeks activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Table 1 in this very highly cited study demonstrated differences between baseline study and control populations characteristics that were substantially different from what would have been expected to result from randomization. A year later in 2018, the study authors in collaboration with the NEJM editors retracted the original 2013 study and published a revised analysis that addressed the sampling errors that had been identified (3). As such, the source of error here is methodological (i.e., research design was complex; this increased the number of protocol items, processes, and likelihood of human error).\n",
    "\n",
    "Estruch et al and PREDIMED conducted a review of how participants were assigned to various interventions groups. This effort revealed irregularities in their randomization procedures. As honest and responsible scientists, they withdrew the original report and published a new one. It is worth noting that once corrected the protocol deviations did not result in any significant change in estimates and inferences from the study, consistent with what one would expect from small random error from a very large study. To date, the original, retracted study has been cited close to 6000 times whereas the corrected one has been cited about 2000 times.\n",
    "\n",
    "I read the original study when it was published in 2013 and its only because of this weeks assignment that I’ve learned about the retraction — pure chance!!!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "PART B\n",
    "\n",
    "As described by the authors in their original study, the PREDIMED trial was a parallel-group, multcenter, randomized trial (2). 7447 participants from Europe, Central or South America, and other countries across the world were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three dietary intervention groups across. \n",
    "\n",
    "Was the randomization process performed at the individual level (i.e., 7447 independently sampled persons)? No, since the study included members from the same households, 11 study sites (i.e., intra-site correlations in statistical analysis), and in general inconsistent use of randomization procedures at some sites (4).\n",
    "\n",
    "The revised analyses corrected the statistical correlations within families and clinics, omitted 1588 participants whose trial-group assignments were unknown or suspected to have departed from protocol, and estimates and p-values recalculated. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite these revelations no significant change in the results was observed. As mentioned earlier, this is somewhat consistent with the nature of errors arising randomly as contrasted with those arising systematically — as discussed in part A. That said, the discovery of these random errors highlights a self-correcting aspect already intrinsic to science, namely the systematic review and meta-analysis of already published works. \n",
    "\n",
    "No recommendations will change the activity of the kind of welcome vigilantism demonstrated by Carlisle. One sees that its quite remarkable that Carlisle approached the issue from a purely statistical perspective and had an impact at the very highest tiers of pier review, the New England Journal of Medicine, and in a field of expertise (nutrition) that they may not have had any particular interest in! One also sees how responsive and responsible the authors Estruch et al were. And so this entire retraction story is quite reassuring in terms of the prospects of science or its current status. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, I wish to recommend one other consideration. That we restore the old practice of reporting p-values in Table 1 of randomized trials, to demonstrate balance across trial arms. It used to be a standard practice across journals until p-values became unfashionable in certain high circles. \n",
    "\n",
    "Also, I recommend that we restore the practice of using a flow chart to describe the sampling design of study participants. Such a chart as Figure 1 may have highlighted to reviewers and readers the sampling error committed by the authors and this might have been addressed in the peer-review period or in an editorial as early as 2013.\n",

Such a move, they aver, will put an end to the discrimination, harassment and victimisation that Banyarwanda continue to be subjected to.\n",

    "===================\n",
    "\n",
    "TEAM GASHUMBA CONCERNS:\n",
    "\n",
    "i) Are there Native Banyarwanda citizens of Uganda?\n",
    "\n",
    "Refer to Population Census records in Uganda, starting in 1911; then 1921, 1931; 1948, then 1959 - before the influx of Refugees fro Rwanda, and 1969.\n",
    "In all these Population Counts, Banyarwanda consistently turned out between 6% and 7% of the population, making it 6th or 7th largest ethnic group in Uganda, most of them in Buganda, Kigezi and Ankole.\n",
    "Needless to say, There are, indeed, BANYARWANDA of UGANDA, equal citizens with the rest, who need not explain themselves more than is reasonable or as required of others.\n",
    "\n",
    "As at 1893, there was no entity called Uganda. In present day western Uganda, there were several disparate Chiefdoms and Kingdoms, such as Mpororo, Nkore, Tooro & Bunyoro, which, in peace or in war, had close relations with other neighbouring kingdoms of Rwanda, Karagwe, Kooki, Buganda among others. Consequently, their respective people's would move across borders, to flee conflict or in search of opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 1894, the British procured the first consent for 'British Protection' from Buganda. Other territories were subsequently added - Ankole, Tooro, Bunyoro etc. to form the 'Uganda British Protectorate' - until Independence in 1962.\n",
    "\n",
    "The very first Constitution - The 1962 (Lancaster negotiated) Independence Constitution of Uganda established the 'Persons to become citizens of Uganda, on 9th October 1962.\n",
    "It covers most Banyarwanda in Uganda.\n",
    "============\n",
    "\n",
    "1962: UGANDA INDEPENDENCE CONSTITUTION:\n",
    "\n",
    "CHAPTER II: CITIZENSHIP 7(1):\n",
    "\"Every person who, having been born in Uganda, is on 8th October 1962 a  citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies or a British protected person, shall become a citizen of Uganda on 9th October 1962:\n",
    " - \"Provided that person shall not become a citizen of Uganda by virtue of this subsection, if neither of his parents was born in Uganda.\"\n",

    "CHAPTER 3: CITIZENSHIP 9.\n",
    "Citizens of Uganda:\n",
    "\"Every person who, on the commencement of this Constitution, is a citizen of Uganda shall continue to be such a citizen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The several categories of Banyarwanda in Uganda have been articulated elsewhere - including:\n",
    "- Those who were 'bordered/ fenced-in' by the new Colonial Borders of Uganda;\n",
    "- The various migrations, before and after 1926 up to 1959;\n",
    "- Refugees\n",
    "- Other Migrant workers\n",
    "\n",
    "If I may speak for most of my compatriots originally from areas bordering Rwanda -\n",
    "- The Greater Kigezi and Greater Ankole, many of our fathers, grandfathers or close relatives were enlisted and served under the King's African Rifles (KAR); Others served under the Kingdom Offices, Others were good Tax payers etc. Our parents, grandparents and those among us who were alive, were indeed and truly \"British Protected Persons\", on 8th October, 1962, who became citizens on the 9th October 1962.\n",
    "\n",
    "My own maternal grandfather, AZARIYA KANYAMIBWA, was present, at the Kamwezi signing of the Protocol between Great Britain and Germany, Describing the Frontier between the Uganda Protectorate and German East Africa, Signed at Kamwezi in 1911.\n",
    "He was also one of the Local Officials who accompanied the Enganzi (Primier) of Ankole, NUWA MBAGUTA, together with Europeans, in the demarcation of the Uganda/ Rwanda border. But my family was not alone in the border area; until 1960s, Banyarwanda made up a majority along the Rwanda border.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notwithstanding the obvious explanations, however, reports and complaints abound, of harassment and discrimination that Banyarwanda in Uganda continue to suffer, especially when they need to access public services. It is wrong, to regularly require greater proof of citizenship, for instance, from members of one particular ethnic community than is asked of others.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii) SHOULD BANYARWANDA of UGANDA CHANGE NAME?\n",
    ".\n",
    "As has been stated elsewhere by many Banyarwanda, the suggestion is not only uninformed, it is unreasonable and ridiculous:\n",
    "- It is uninformed, because most of the offenders do it out of malice; It would only be fair to expect them still to continue in their 'ill will' machinations against the Banyarwanda community, no matter the name.\n",
    "Many still recall the 'Ethnic Cleansing' of 1982, in which more than 100,000 Banyarwanda were expelled by the UPC Government and UPC functionaries, especially from 'Greater Ankole..!' Citizens were forced into Refugee Camps in Uganda, while others were driven across the border into Rwanda - only to die in thousands, in poorly managed refugee camps.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among those expelled, were thousands who had completely assimilated into other communities, who could no longer speak or comprehend The Kinyarwanda language. To many who witnessed the treachery of neighbour against neighbour, in Communities and would-be Places of Refuge, the Churches, the 'Name Change' suggestion just comes as a 'Bad Joke..!'\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, the suggestion is ridiculous, because the Banyarwanda is a nation of people, spread across the East and Central African states, and around the world; they are native in the D.R.Congo, in Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda; Kinyarwanda/ Kirundi is probably third most widely spoken language in Africa - after Arabic and Swahili; sizable populations of Banyarwanda has also grown in other parts of Africa, Europe and the Americas.\n",
    "Banyarwanda are a Nation of people, scattered by circumstances throughout the world, but whose Culture is a great source of Strength to be sought - not to be shunned..!! There're many people groups that would 'kill to be allowed into' such a MILLENIUM-OLD kith and kin association.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just to demonstrate one element of this Community Strength that many members will already be familiar with - \"GUSHUMBUSH' INKA\":\n",
    "\n",
    "The Banyarwanda Culture compels community members 'Kugir' UBUNTU n' UBUPFURA..!!'\n",
    "(To be kind-hearted and considerate of others);\n",
    "Custom requires one to be mindful of one's neighbour's dire needs; your neighbour is to be treated as your own brother, whose nakedness, hunger or want becomes your own nakedness and shame..! Others will think you less, if you do not reach out..! So powerful and compelling..!\n",
    "If, for instance, your neighbour or relative fell on hard times - lost most of his (cattle) wealth, his fault or not, it becomes your duty to work it out with him and others, as to how best to quickly cover his shame and need - to keep that man's, and community dignity.\n",
    "Banyarwanda would give him cows - to be returned after 3 to 7 years or much longer, when the man has been able to get back on his 'feet' - \"KWITURA\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This, to the envy of many.., protesting:\n",

    "iii) THE AFRICA CONTEXT - The Legacy of Arbitrary Colonial Boundaries:\n",
    "On all borders of Uganda, as oft the case for most African countries, one finds communities that were separated by The Arbitrary 'Pen of The 1884/85 Berlin Conference', wherein the European Powers greedily partitioned and distributed the African lands among themselves - like hyenas on the weakened buffalo..!\n",
    "Already, Communities were also often found straddled across recognised frontiers of pre-colonial kingdoms. People would move to flee conflict or in search of food and pasture.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the Partition of Africa - Uganda, like most other African colonies, was handed artificial border lines that literally split families and communities apart..!\n",
    "In Kenya, they had to contend with the question of 'KENYAN SOMALI' natives of Northern Kenya. In Angola, they have a large native population of 'BAKONGO' - same people as those in Congo (DRC) and in the other Congo Republic; In South Africa, there's a native 'SOTHO Tribe' - kinsmen to the people of LESOTHO. SO WE ARE NOT ALONE..!\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly in UGANDA: We have, at our borders, the same populations as the neighbouring countries. Kenya and Uganda share several ethnic communities: Samia, Bakusu/ Bagisu, Iteso etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "There was an interesting story in The Daily Nation of Kenya recently:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A Tale of Two UGANDA Kings Who Hold Big Sway In Kenya Politics:\n",
    "Cultural kings are recognised in the Ugandan Constitution — not in Kenya — but traditional powers bestowed upon two kings in Eastern Uganda spill over to Kenya.\n",
    "One King, of the Bamasaba brings together the Bagisu of Uganda and Bukusu of Kenya of a common ancestry, King Wamimbi; and the King of the Itesos of Kenya and Uganda, His Highness Papa Emormor; Both have commanding respect among their subjects inside Uganda and Kenya.\n",
    "In the last Kenya elections, a Ugandan cultural king was implored to intervene and strike a truce between two senior political leaders who were at loggerheads in Western Kenya - Ministers Moses Wetang’ula (Trade) and Eugene Wamalwa (Justice and Constitutional Affairs), both from the Bukusu community, were key pillars for Cord and Jubilee coalition campaigns in the region.\n",
    "“I was approached by some leaders from Kenya to reconcile the two politicians..,” Bamasaba King  Wilson Wamimbi (Omukuka)  told The Standard on Sunday in an interview at his Busano home near Mbale town, Eastern Uganda.\n",
    "But perhaps the most dramatic case to demonstrate the travesty served the African communities, is that of the renowned Awori family - also on the Kenya border.\n",
    "The Tale of two Awori Brothers:\n",
    "MOODY AWORI (b. 1928-) was the 9th Vice President of Kenya under President Kibaki; And\n",
    "AGGREY AWORI (b. 1939) former MP, Minister for ICT & former Presidential Candidate in Uganda..!\n",
    "The two brothers, from a family and clan that straddles across what was later to become the Uganda-Kenya border are sons of Rev. Canon Jeremiah Musungu Awori, a pioneer priest of what was then known as the Native Anglican Church (NAC) in East Africa, and his wife,\n",
    "Mrs. Mariamu Odongo Awori, a nurse and community teacher. Rev. Canon Jeremiah Musungu Awori was son of Awori Khatamonga - a fabled elephant hunter who operated at the Uganda-Kenya border from the mid-1800s.\n",
    " At one time, the two brothers - Aggrey Awori & Moody Awori were serving respectively in Uganda Cabinet and Kenya Cabinet; One was running for President in Uganda, the other became Kenya's Vice President.\n",
    "\n",
    "There're many other similar cases, albeit less dramatic:\n",
    "A classmate of mine at King's College, Budo, from Sebei, like many Ugandans, fled to Kenya, during Gen. Idi Amin's mayhem. On reaching Nairobi, he became a Kalenjin - President Moi's ethnic group..! Another friend of mine, from Karamoja, on completing studies in Mbale and Makerere University, went to Kenya and quickly became a Pokot - he's still serving in  Cabinet..!\n",
    "Our own Hon. Dr. Chebrot, my classmate and former State Minister, was very much at home in Kenya, until opportunities improved in Uganda.\n",
    "\n",
    "The same can be said of almost every borderline: The ITESO people, for instance, are to be found in 'Greater Teso' of Uganda; But there is also a large community of ITESO people who inhabit Tororo and Busia areas; And across the border, in Kenya, we find a district called 'ITESO' District mostly populated by the Iteso..!\n",
    "Similarly: A large population of the ACHOLI people in South Sudan; the LUGBARA, ALUR, BATOORO/ BAHUMA & several others, are also native in the Democratic Republic of Congo..!!\n",
    "In Europe: Switzerland has four tribes: Germans, French and Italians and the Romanche;\n",
    "Belgium has a large French tribe; Austria and Hungary, the Germans.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Uganda's Southern Flank: The people of KARAGWE in Tanzania, are quite similar to the people of ANKOLE & KOOKI (RAKAI District).\n",
    "Still on south western border of Uganda, is RWANDA, with whom Uganda has had much interaction for centuries - in war and in peace. Consequently, many Runyankore/ Rukiga speaking communities were caught on the Rwanda side; and many Kinyarwanda speaking people were 'Demarcated' inside Uganda, in addition to others, in Ntungamo, Rukiga, Kabale & Kisoro, whose territories were adjusted and place inside Uganda, by European Agreements.\n",
    "Former Rwanda President HABYARIMANA, for example, was a MUKIGA from Gisenyi, North-western Rwanda, bordering Kigezi.\n",
    "To the North-East of Rwanda, is the Umutara province, where native Runyankore speaking cattle keeping (Bahima) of the Bagina, Bashambo and other clans were settled. Some of them - Kataraiha and Kisiribombo - were appointed by the Rwanda King as Superior Chiefs. Most of these Bahima communities remained in Rwanda until the 1990/ '94 war.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv) THE GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE ON ETHNIC RIVALRY And CONFLICT:\n",
    "From the end of WWII in 1945 to the 'Fall of The Berlin Wall' in 1989, Global Conflict was mostly driven by 'The Cold War' between The USA and USSR.\n",
    "But now all over the world, especially in the last 30 years, the world is at war with itself - Conflict mostly driven by Nationalist Extremism. Ethnic conflict has been cause of much suffering, war & destruction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nationalism was principally responsible for starting both WWI & WWII.\n",
    "By 1900, the Austria-Hungary Empire was the largest and most powerful political entity in mainland Europe, holding together a dozen disparate ethnic communities, including: Germans, Hungarians, Polish, Czech, Ukrainians, Slovak, Slovene, Croatians, Serbs, Italians and the Romanians.\n",
    "The Slovacs nationalists in Bosnia and Herzegovina, however, were no longer happy under the Austria-Hungary rule; they considered themselves Serbians, and preferred to have their territory ruled by their kith, in Serbia.\n",
    "Over time, tensions rose. A Slovac terrorist assassinated an Austria-Hungarian Duke. Then war was launched: Austria declared war on Serbia, which quickly drew in Germany, Russia, Britain, France .. The rest is just history, of 10 million dead, 25 million maimed. And a Global Economy on its knees. ALL FOR TRIBAL/ Ethnic ANIMOSITIES...!!\n",
    "\n",
    "Banyarwanda of Uganda are not alone..!!\n",
    "Many countries seem to be struggling with nationalist sentiments. The world headlines are filled with Nationalist Conflicts, laden with Ethnic emotions:\n",
    "Whether you look at Germany or France; the Uighur Muslims in China, the Political contests in South Sudan, the Rohingya Muslims of Myanmar. The world needs a considered response.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the United Staes of America, 'Black Lives Matter' is the Battle cry for African-Americans; and now Asian-Americans seem to be the immediate target. The world is aflame with tribal rage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Personally, I think one of the most backward element included in our Constitution was the promotion of Ethnic loyalties - requiring even the most patriotic Ugandan to first identify with some tribal grouping..!!\n",
    "A most unfortunate inclusion..!\n",

    "Excerpts From Counsel EDGAR TABARO, son of Retired Justice Tabaro:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"..  Early recorded migrations of Banyarwanda to Uganda in their hordes was at the beginning of the first decade of the 20th Century, when cash crop was introduced by Mitchel Cotts the successor to the Uganda Company (incorporated 1896) itself a successor to the Imperial British East Africa Company (IBEACO) that had a royal charter. The early migrants are mainly in areas of tea production in Namutamba and Tooro where they worked as wage earners although a good number took up other menial jobs in other counties of Buganda and their descendant continue to live.\n",
    "In 1910, the Anglo - German – Belgian conference was held in Brussels,  which resulted in several agreements ...  between Belgium and Germany .. One, signed at Brussels, on May 14, 1910, settling the boundary between German East Africa and the Belgian Colony of the Congo. \n",
    "Another Signed at Brussels, August 11, 1910, further on a Protocol between Great Britain and Germany Describing the Frontier between the Uganda Protectorate and German East Africa. Finally confirmed, Signed at Kamwezi, October 30, 1911. \n",

    "\n",
    "These two legal documents transferred territories of Rwanda Kingdom Provinces of Bufumbira (present day Kisoro District), and Ndorwa (present day Kabale, Rubanda and Rukiga Districts), and areas of Ntungamo that were inhabited by native Banyarwanda communities.\n",
    "\n",
    " It is worth noting that these are the persons referred to as Banyarwanda, an the indigenous community of Uganda as per the 3rd Schedule to the Constitution, though the ones of Bufumbira (later) assumed the identity of Bafumbira.  \n",
    " For a long time under both colonial and post-colonial administrations in Uganda, the areas inhabited by the Banyarwanda communities did not benefit from any form of affirmative action, a result of which the community was heavily impoverished. \n",
    "Infact, it was a deliberate government policy to reserve the areas as a cheap source for labour for the plantations and other richer agricultural regions. However, over the years, descendants of these people, (through hard work and discipline) have been able to lift themselves out of the shackles of poverty and ignorance, which may not necessarily endear them to other communities, hence exacerbating their resentment.\n",
    "To this end, the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, the following persons shall be citizens of Uganda by birth—\n",
    " (a) Every person born in Uganda one of whose parents or grandparent/s is or was a member of any of the indigenous communities existing and residing within the borders of Ugandaas at the first day of February, 1926, and set out in the Third Schedule to this Constitution. \n",

    "\n",
    "I think the philosophy underpinning statistics must be addressed to foster positive change in regard to intellectual honesty and integrity of science. \n",
    "\n",
    "Two schools of philosophy exist in the world of statistical inference: Frequentist and Bayesian (1).\n",
    "\n",
    "To those unfamiliar with these schools I’m 100% certain that your exposure to statistics has been Frequentist. And to those familiar with these schools, it is without a doubt to any of you that the chief reason Bayesian statistics are not routinely taught at most levels of education (including most doctoral programs at as prestigious an institution of Johns Hopkins) is because they are complex (2).\n",
    "\n",
    "But what is universally understood about these two schools of statistical inference? Fundamentally, the frequentist school relies too heavily on any single study for statistical inference whereas the Bayesian school formalizes our prior beliefs, then formalizes a statistical interaction between the strength of those prior beliefs and the latest findings from the latest study, and then the prior beliefs are thereby updated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sounds complex? Yeah, that’s why they don’t teach these methods! And therein lies the problem (3). As a community, we have chosen the easy path of Frequentist statistics that relies exclusively on one study, arbitrary p-values, and all the machinations of the authors of that study including their rigor, their proneness to error, their sloppiness, and their integrity. The tough way of Bayesian statistics is always a community effort, codified in the Bayesian prior knowledge, which always tempers the new information from the new study.\n",
    "\n",
    "A fraudster who understands Bayesian statistics and who also is aware that peer reviewers and the audience at large are all masters of Bayesian statistics will be preempted from committing fraud. This would mean that teaching Bayesian statistics per se would be a preemptive solution to fraud rather than a reactive one, something described by the Director of the Office of Science Quality and Integrity as the ideal solution (4).\n",
    "\n",
    "On a conservative note, Frequentists have met Bayesian halfway using meta-analysis to pool inferences from several studies and to reach one unifying conclusion about our best estimate of an effect size and the degree of our uncertainty (or heterogeneity across studies). Perhaps if these frequentist methods were not restricted to advanced courses, then fraudsters may also realize that their individual efforts will be fraught if they differ substantively from the rest of the literature. In other words, a fraudster would be certain to be found out!\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude, I am pessimistic about the moral integrity of the individual scientist for reasons outlined in my previous two posts. But I’m optimistic about the collective integrity of science for reasons also outlined in my previous post, which today I formally christen “Bayesian inference.” \n",

    "There are two outlooks to life. One is of the ascetic priest and involves self-denial of the innate pleasures derived from food, sex, and violence. The other is cut-throat and is marked by expenditure of energy on a worthy enemy, recuperated by way of the spoils of war, and an unquenchable lust for the next battle. \n",
    "\n",
    "One outlook is more likely to yield modern day “struggles” against mental health, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. The ascetic priest might win their several “battles” against our species-essence and achieve longevity following a consistent spiritual and physical life-course marked by self-denial. But their followers will often fall short of expectations in this metaphysical battle; thereby becoming anxious, guilty, and alas, both spiritually and physically ill.  \n",
    "\n",
    "More inline with our innate predilections, the warriors outlook can be represented as the military school of life: that which doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. So the option any person or tribe or nation faces is simple: keep fighting..  or yield (to unnatural asceticism or to the enemy).\n",
    "\n",
    "Between these two stark options one will find the marvelous delusions that civilized man has crafted. Pacifism, United Nations, World Trade Organization, War Crimes Tribunals, et cetera. We might then conclude that modern man is at risk of completely alienating himself from his essence, were it not for creative solutions that rescue him from despair — such as the Olympics, the World Cup, Boxing 🥊, the cult of exercise, or the depiction of violence in film and literature. The cult of Hero worship is the vestige of a species that coulda woulda shoulda been warrior-like, were it not for its frailty. Oh frailty, thy name is man! \n",
    "\n",
    "And so one may ask whether mans’ creative excuses achieve their cathartic purpose. Or whether they merely postpone the inevitable regression to our species essence, while making man more frail, diseased, and ill-suited for this purpose. But such are the questions one needs to ask to restore vitality and meaning to life. Only then might the taunting & mocking of childhood make sense, and only then might the bullying and humiliating initiations rites in teenage & fraternities find a context, and of course only then might the fierce competition amongst high school girls & just as much between corporate be understood as a mere side-show — to the original cut-throat essence of the species. Participants in these “battles amongst lost sheep” most certainly will seek a priest or therapist or opium dealer at some point in their life. Without expending a sufficient amount of energy on overpowering a worthy enemy, the modern man hoards his energy and — because E=mc2 — locks it in as obesity. All the prescriptions of the ascetic priest (really perpetuating factors of disease if you think of it) — purging oneself of food, the moralization of sex, and the proposition of kindness as the highest virtue —  glorify hibernation. Increased life expectancy thus becomes the proof of progress. And thats how a life is put to complete waste.. in the pursuit of some ideal where there is no blood.\n",

    "Last week I suggested that we apply a scientific method of inquiry into the Open Science Recommendations so that we do not take our dear reproducibility activists at their own word. \n",
    "\n",
    "I had no clue that I was already dabbling in meta science. So it really is possible to actively engage in an endeavor without having a name or definition for it. And so the 93 minutes of the first Youtube video dedicated to the question “What is Metascience?” tells me that perhaps our time and effort here could have been spent on more practical issues. \n",
    "\n",
    "The crux of the 93 minute video is that metascience is research on research. That for me is enough. The object of interest is scientific research. And the investigators who do research on research are doing meta science. What methods do they employ? What is the epistemology? They should be in essence the same used in science including trials, experiments, statistical analyses of findings, inferences, and conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "One discussant has a vision of meta science as being interdisciplinary, with no boundaries across science fields. While I will not discuss this in detail here, I am not at all optimistic of this proposal because in the real world funding and financing of science is key to its sustenance. And the proposed cross-disciplinary meta science is likely to remain an orphan since each science is sui generis — has its own unique set of issues, challenges, and most pressing questions — none of which is meta science. \n",
    "\n",
    "What research topic would I choose to address if I had unlimited means? I would choose to develop an automated methodology that generates a meta-analysis of each paper submitted for peer-review to tell us how the inferences from the meta-analysis look before and after the new study is incorporated into the scientific literature. I’d then ask the authors, reviewers, and journal editors to write a one-sentence speculation on what makes this study unique to the existing literature. \n",
    "\n",
    "Anyone familiar with Lancet, JAMA, and several top-tier medical journals knows that they already publish a brief  research-in-context panel (What was known before? What does this paper contribute? And what remains unknown?) (1). What I propose is quantitive and reported with a classic forest-plot \n",
    "\n",
    "My proposition would be embedded within existing research frameworks, modes of publication, and methods, and would only face opposition if it entailed extra effort for researchers. Hence, I envision this to be an automated process. The authors of the original science or the journal editors would only need to enter key items such as study outcome, risk factors, and outcome metrics. This would be original research but also placed in a broader context as research on research (i.e., meta-analysis and commentary).\n",

    "Part I: \n",
    "I think a fundamental logical fallacy in “Big Sugar’s Secret Ally? Nutritionists” is to mistake cause with effect (1). The basic hypothesis of the article is that the 655% increase in prevalence of Americans with diabetes over the last 60 years is caused by an increase in consumption of sugar. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the true causal relationship is that diabetes causes an increase in blood sugar levels, not the other way around wherein increased blood sugar levels (from dietary sources) increase likelihood of diabetes.\n",
    "\n",
    "What causes diabetes? More specifically, what causes type-II diabetes (the epidemic kind)? The answer is an increased resistance to the effects of insulin, arising often from a change in body composition with more percent body fat than muscle. Adipose tissue is insulin resistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the cause of increased body fat over the last 60 years is reduced physical activity and more or less sedentary life style amongst Americans of most ages. \n",
    "\n",
    "To say obesity is caused “by a lack of energy balance” is incontestable. The article correctly quotes the NIH in saying “in other words, by our taking in more calories than we expend.” But then the author reveals their bias by focusing on the “taking in more calories” and completely neglecting the “more than we expend.” Hence, the entire article focuses on how food may influence our body weight through their caloric content.”\n",
    "\n",
    "But how about how increased activity and exercise may moderate our appetite and thus our calorie intake (2)? This question uncovers the authors biased question and article title. It blinds us to the cause of dietary intake, namely, the hormones and endorphins that regulate our appetite in the first place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Modern persons at all the stages of life including childhood, teenage, young adulthood, middle life, and later life have drastically reduced outdoor activity. Many more more video games, increased indoor entertainment through television, sprawling of suburbs and reliance on cars for every mode of movement (from home to grocery store, to school, to work, etc.) and such pattern have increased exponentially over the last 60 years and are the fundamental problem. Sedentary people eat more than active ones. So dietary intake is an effect arising from physical inactivity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course the consequence of the logical fallacy discussed here is the focus on diet and nutrition instead of physical activity, lifestyle, and environmental engineering that may nudge individuals back to what their ancestors did: more physical activity for daily tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Part II:\n",
    "\n",
    "My favorite example of a statistical fallacy comes from American politics but may as well apply to clinical studies. Over the last 40 years, the American senate has had either a majority democrat or republican representation. But by majority I mean 51% (majority party) vs. 49% (minority party) of the 100 senators, two from each state. Just today, with Georgia’s senate runoff election complete, the democrats hold 51 of the 100 senate seats (3). \n",
    "\n",
    "Those is the majority interpret this as the electoral mandate of the people who have chosen them over their rivals.\n",
    "\n",
    "But when you subject this to statistical inference this is essentially not different from the toss of a coin or a random electoral event bearing absolutely no meaning. When you toss a coin 100 times (to elect the senators), that may count as a sample size of n=100. And the majority of 51% may count as p=0.51. The standard error is given by the square root of p(1-p)/n, 0.05. Thus such a slim majority is 51% (95% CI: 41.2%-60.8%).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we see that this isn’t statistically significantly different from the null-hypothesis from a coin toss (pure chance, luck) of 50%.\n",

    "\n",
    "Reflections on an over-examined life: navel gazers unite!\n",
    "\n",
    "It's high time someone gave us political recognition. Not that we'd ever actually vote, of course. We're far too busy working through The Artist's Way to leave the apartment for anything other than brie and cigarettes. But we like the idea of voting. We like the idea that social change is but an election ballot away--and personal transformation is as easy as e-mail.\n",
    "\n",
    "If television personality Ally McBeal and radio therapist Dr. Laura Schlessinger were inverse halves of the same brain, they would exemplify the mind of the Postmodern Navel Gazer: the gourmet cheese-loving, expensively educated, Gen-X individualists who spend our waking hours trying to have our pain and ease it too. Heads without bodies (with sporadic alcohol-induced reversals), we applaud Dr. Laura's self-help sound bites while at the same time empathizing with Ally's endless neuroses. Is this fuzz in my navel lint or inconsistency?\n",
    "\n",
    "At least three assumptions characterize the navel gazing mentality as I understand it:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumption 1: You believe that desire is better than satiation and take steps to ensure that you always want that which you can never have. Happiness is not sexy. Longing is.\n",
    "Assumption 2: You boast a nihilistic exterior yet secretly believe The Truth is out there. But you want X-Files Agent Scully to find it for you. She's not a poet and she's not emaciated, so she has more time and energy than you to do that sort of thing.\n",
    "Assumption 3: You gravitate toward quick-fix solutions to complex psychological and social problems. This Minute Rice approach helps ensure that while you continue to self-destruct, you can relax in the belief that change is just around the bend--should you ever decide to get out of bed and look for it.\n",
    "Take my friend Gwen as an example. Gwen worships Dr. Laura with religious intensity. Her bookshelf displays Ten Stupid Things Women Do to Mess Up Their Lives at one end and, to placate the feminists, Ten Stupid Things Men Do at the other. She listens faithfully to Dr. Laura's daily denunciations of codependence, moral indecision, working mothers and drug-puffing teens. \"Instant therapy,\" Gwen calls her show.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, she never actually follows Dr. Laura's advice. That would be taking things to an extreme. No, Gwen is quite content remaining, like Ally, perpetually unhappy; she's addicted to The English Patient and to angst-ridden Ally McBeal list-servs. She complains of having lost her \"passion\" for religion. She repeats relational mistakes dozens of times, then spends Kleenex-filled evenings rereading old journals. How could she have time to pursue a healthy relationship, a spiritual life or meaningful work? Thousands of eighth grade diary pages are still waiting to be deconstructed!\n",
    "\n",
    "Every so often I experience doubts about the implications of postmodern navel gazing. Periodically I wake to looming questions I would rather let Scully--or maybe a licensed ethicist--address. What are the moral, social and political consequences of an over-examined life? Can a person care responsibly for his or her \"self\" without becoming solipsistic and without abandoning responsibility to the common or public good? Does Generation X need an ethic of self-reflection?\n",
    "\n",
    "One could argue, after all, that Dr. Laura's tactics for self-reflection are highly unethical. She interrupts working mothers with unjustified accusations of greed and selfishness. She applies careless verbal Band-Aids to gaping psychological and social wounds. She doesn't listen; she simply swoops in for the therapeutic kill.\n",
    "\n",
    "One could also argue that Dr. Laura is as myopic as her waifish opposite. Ally's television show is a celebration of destructive behavior; Dr. Laura's radio show is a two-second \"solution\" to lifelong patterns of destructive behavior. Neither program bothers to distinguish between damaging versus constructive forms of self-examination. Neither pauses to consider the consequences of representing ethical and psychological lethargy as entertainment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thankfully, however, I have discovered that coffee and cigarettes provide an excellent antidote to such bothersome late-night misgivings. Armed with mug and cancer stick, I can proclaim to my rapt stuffed animals that while solipsism, social responsibility and myopic stagnation might be worth addressing, I personally do not have the time or luxury to look into any of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is because I am busy perfecting my use of the navel gazer's favorite academic term: \"paradox.\" Paradox is a good word because it allows us to be as contradictory as possible without having to explain our actions or justify a lack of personal ethics. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Question: \"But Stacia, how can you applaud Dr. Laura's absolutist moralistic tone while at the same time wallowing in Ally's haze of moral and personal ambiguity?\" Answer: \"It's a paradox!\"\n",
    "\n",
    "See how handy the word is? Thank God for higher education.\n",
    "\n",
    "Navel gazers, take heart: Contrary to what that awful therapist once told you, being pathologically unhappy or perpetually self-destructive is not a bad thing. Our supposed flaws are actually rare gifts: They not only provide poetic distraction from healthy relationships and from life's deepest questions, they also make terrific diet aids. Just look at Ally: She's so busy chewing on her own personal drama, her body has disappeared almost entirely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that's what I call self-absorption.\n",

    "Viagra was developed and studied in phase I clinical trials for hypertension and angina pectoris (1). It’s therapeutic effects were not substantive and did not reach phase II or III trials.

    "\n",
    "Within 3 months of FDA licensing in 1998 (4), Pfizer had earned $400m from viagra and over the next 20 years leading to expiry of its patent in 2020 the annual earnings from the sale of viagra were $1.2 - $2.0b, with a cumulative total of $27.6b as of 2020 (5).\n",
    "\n",
    "The market for viagra and its competitors is expected to continue growing according to the WHO. Increased burden of lifestyle disease and sedentary lifestyle interact to cause erectile dysfunction. At a prevalence of 15% of the male population, it is projected by WHO to reach 320m persons by 2025 (6). Such is the story of an entirely serendipitous discovery by otherwise astute scientists and clinicians that were meticulous enough to profit from unintended consequences.\n",

    "\n",
    "BACKGROUND: Air pollution kills approximately one million in Africa each year. Fine particles, designated PM2.5, with a diameter of 2.5 μm or less penetrate deep into the lungs and blood streams unfiltered, causing heart attacks, respiratory disease, and premature death more frequently — but alas also more subtly —  than, say, poor nutrition or sedentary life do. Exponential growth in the second-hand car industry, among other factors, is a worrisome driver of this silent epidemic. But it is hard to know how bad the problem is with African governments prioritizing virtually all other better known and more visible problems they are faced with.\n",
    "\n",
    "METHODS: We will deploy one hundred real-time sensors of 24-Hour PM2.5 Levels (μg/m3) from across select Ugandan districts and along high-traffic routes in select cities (unit cost starting at $25) to document how exposed unwitting Ugandan citizens are to hazardous levels of environmental pollution. From the convenience of a webApp, any Ugandan citizen or foreigner visiting Uganda or planning to visit Uganda will have free access to this information. Regulatory authorities in Uganda will be notified of this service, as will the public — via subtle but powerful media compaigns about this “silent killer.”\n",

    "An interesting question. My short answer is, \"With difficulty.\" To expand on that, they are such different men in such different cultures and circumstances that it is tough to make useful comparisons. Both are major figures in their realms. Both are skilled warriors. Both are intelligent. Both are proud, and both are close to their fathers. Both delay crucial violence. Beyond that, however…it's hard to say. Hamlet is forever divided and in his head. Achilles, by contrast, is driven by emotion. Hamlet wants to be absolutely right before he acts. Achilles acts, and trusts his actions to be right. Hamlet seems fond of Ophelia, but his ego is not bound to hers. By contrast, Achilles doesn't seem fond of any woman, but his ego is bound to them as his prize. In other words, as ascetic priest vs warrior   \n",

Nietzsche was enlisted as an authority for articulating the movement's ruptured relationship with the past and a force in its drive to normalization and its activist ideal of self-creating Hebraic New Man.\"   \n",

    "It is obvious that in his day-dreams he is a warrior, not a professor; all of the men he admires were military. His opinion of women, like every man's, is an objectification of his own emotion towards them, which is obviously one of fear. \"Forget not thy whip\"-- but nine women out of ten would get the whip away from him, and he knew it, so he kept away from women, and soothed his wounded vanity with unkind remarks. [...] [H]e is so full of fear and hatred that spontaneous love of mankind seems to him impossible. He has never conceived of the man who, with all the fearlessness and stubborn pride of the superman, nevertheless does not inflict pain because he has no wish to do so. Does any one suppose that Lincoln acted as he did from fear of hell? Yet to Nietzsche, Lincoln is abject, Napoleon magnificent. [...] I dislike Nietzsche because he likes the contemplation of pain, because he erects conceit into duty, because the men whom he most admires are conquerors, whose glory is cleverness in causing men to die. But I think the ultimate argument against his philosophy, as against any unpleasant but internally self-conscious ethic, lies not in an appeal to facts, but in an appeal to the emotions. Nietzsche despises universal love; I feel it the motive power to all that I desire as regards the world. His followers have had their innings, but we may hope that it is coming rapidly to an end.\n",

And that by his stripes we might find a way to heaven, but that the earthly portion of the journey goes according to Gods will and not ours — we are not masters of this universe. Thus health, wealth, and miracles are not necessarily promised. Instead, our faith should clarify the path we should take, a path that will involve acts of love to other more needy folks.. as Jesus taught.  "

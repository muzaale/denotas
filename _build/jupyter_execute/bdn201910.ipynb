    "Dorry: One of the things that we've wanted to do, is to take the granularity of the CKD pc data and the life-time risk methodology and apply that to donors so we could give them a life-time risk of ESRD post-donation. As you show, there is a huge difference by biological relative. I think one thing that would be to extend the calculator the donor characteristics but by the donor-recipient relationship.¬†  \n",

    "‚ÄúA first, tentative example: at all times morality has aimed to ‚Äúimprove‚Äù men ‚Äî this aim is above all what was called morality. Under the same word, however, the most divergent tendencies have been concealed. But ‚Äúimprovement‚Äù has meant both taming the beast called man, and breeding a particular kind of man. Such zoological concepts are required to express the realities ‚Äî realities of which the typical ‚Äúimprover,‚Äù the priest, admittedly neither knows anything nor wants to know anything.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To call the taming of an animal its ‚Äúimprovement‚Äù sounds almost like a joke to our ears. Whoever knows what goes on in kennels doubts that dogs are ‚Äúimproved‚Äù there. They are weakened, they are made less harmful, and through the depressive effect of fear, through pain, through wounds, and through hunger, they become sickly beasts. It is no different with the tamed man whom the priest has ‚Äúimproved.‚Äù In the early Middle Ages, when the church was indeed, above all, a kennel, the most perfect specimens of the ‚Äúblond beast‚Äù were hunted down everywhere; and the noble Teutons, for example, were ‚Äúimproved.‚Äù But how did such an ‚Äúimproved‚Äù Teuton look after he had been drawn into a monastery? Like a caricature of man, a miscarriage: he had become a ‚Äúsinner,‚Äù he was stuck in a cage, tormented with all sorts of painful concepts. And there he lay, sick, miserable, hateful to himself, full of evil feelings against the impulses of his own life, full of suspicion against all that was still strong and happy. In short, a ‚ÄúChristian.‚Äù  \n",
    "\n",
    "Physiologically speaking: in the struggle with beasts, making them sick may be the only way to make them weak. The church understood this: it sickened and weakened man ‚Äî and by so doing ‚Äúimproved‚Äù him.‚Äù  \n",

    "‚ÄúWhat is the meaning of the conceptual opposites which I have introduced into aesthetics, Apollinian and Dionysian, both conceived as kinds of frenzy? The Apollinian frenzy excites the eye above all, so that it gains the power of vision. The painter, the sculptor, the epic poet are visionaries par excellence. In the Dionysian state, on the other hand, the whole affective system is excited and enhanced: so that it discharges all its means of expression at once and drives forth simultaneously the power of representation, imitation, transfiguration, transformation, and every kind of mimicking and acting. The essential feature here remains the ease of metamorphosis, the inability not to react (similar to certain hysterical types who also, upon any suggestion, enter into any role). It is impossible for the Dionysian type not to understand any suggestion; he does not overlook any sign of an affect; he possesses the instinct of understanding and guessing in the highest degree, just as he commands the art of communication in the highest degree. He enters into any skin, into any affect: he constantly transforms himself.‚Äù . \n",

The whole development of the theory turns on the question of whether there are physically preferred stats of motion in Nature (physical relativity problem). Also, concepts and distinctions are only admissible to the extent that observable facts cam be assigned to them without ambiguity (stipulation that concepts and distinctions should have meaning). This postulate, pertaining to epistemology, proves to be of fundamental importance.‚Äú (1)\n",

    "The prominent Einstein consciously practiced philosophy, explicitly conducted thought experiments, brought the rigor of metaphysics to bear upon untenable assumptions that had dogged the world of classical physics since the time of Newton, and set off a scientific and technological revolution that is still in its infancy today. Technology is still playing ‚Äúcatchup‚Äù with the insights articulated by Einstein between 1905 and 1935.¬†\n",
    "\n",
    "Such dependency between metaphysical concepts and empirical verification is not in any way opposed to Feyman‚Äôs conceptualization of the scientific enterprise: postulates, precise predictions, verification (or failure), revision of the postulates, etc. In my final project on the revolution of Organ Transplantation, the ‚Äúconcept‚Äù of replacing a failed human organ with a functioning one from an animal, identical twin, full-sibling, parent, or non-biological relative started just as that ‚Äî a concept. How identical the allograft has to be to the recipient, such as with regard to HLA-DR and immunogenetics, is a matter of metaphysics. Whether such HLA-identity is necessary. Whether such an allograft will survive for a few days or more. Whether the immune rejection of the organ is an ontological fact, or whether it can be changed by immunosuppressive therapy. Whether one can find a donor with identical HLA (i.e., what we now know epistemologically as ‚Äúneccessary‚Äù through tissue typing vs. identical twin in our earlier, more naive epistemology). All these are metaphysical questions the field of transplant grappled with in its early days and still does today. Whether or not transplant professionals are aware they are prating philosophy is one thing. But the fact is that they are. \n",
    "\n",
    "A conscious recognition of this fact may give science the sort of impetus and razor-focus that Einstein had. Maybe the slow progress of science is symptomatic of the neglect of philosophy among prominent modern scientists. We find ourselves ‚Äúreinventing the wheel‚Äú of metaphysics, unwittingly, like Mr. Jourdain.\n",

    " Portrait of Friedrich Nietzsche by Munch\n",
    "Friedrich Nietzsche by Edvard Munch. 1906. Thielska Gallerie, Sweden. Via Wikimedia.\n",
    "Friedrich Nietzsche was one of the most important philosophers of the nineteenth century. Though often misinterpreted, his influence has been enormous. Like his compatriot Schopenhauer, he questioned the comfortable beliefs of the conservative bourgeoisie of his time. His writings have fascinated generations of readers, his style was exquisite, his ideas original. Bertrand Russell called him an aristocratic anarchist.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nietzsche admired the Pre-Socratic philosophers and was sympathetic to the teachings of the Buddha. He formulated the concept of the overman or superman, of the eternal recurrence, of a Dionysian life of gaiety and heroism. For Nietzsche, Christianity was a failure because it promoted a slave-like mentality, and when he said God was dead, he meant it was the belief in God that was dead. He asked whether man was a mistake of God or God a mistake of man. He thought that spiritualizing sensuality as love represented a great triumph over Christianity. He despised the bourgeois ‚Äúherd,‚Äù who loved the police more than their neighbor, and advocated a free life as the desirable state for great souls.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a section of the Twilight of the Idols (1888) titled ‚ÄúMorality for physicians,‚Äù Nietzsche proclaimed that the sick man was a parasite of society and that when the meaning of life and the right to live had been lost it was indecent and contemptible for a man to ‚Äúvegetate in cowardly dependence on physicians and machines.‚Äù2 He argued that death should be freely chosen and cheerfully accomplished, amid children and witnesses instead of the ‚Äúwretched and revolting comedy that Christianity has made of the hour of death.‚Äù ‚ÄúDie at the right time,‚Äù preached the hero of Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883) as he came down from the rarefied atmosphere of his mountain bearing his eagle and his serpent. Yet sadly and paradoxically, this was not what happened to him after his collapse in Turin, and he lingered for many years, bedridden and demented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nietzsche was born in 1844 near Leipzig in Saxony, Germany. He studied classical philology in Bonn and Leipzig, and at age twenty-four was the youngest person to ever be appointed to the chair of philology at the University of Basel (1869). He resigned from that position in 1879 for health reasons and completed most of his writing in the next decade in Switzerland and Italy. There he lived in increasing isolation, usually in a modest, coldly furnished room, his compositions strewn on the floor, an old trunk holding his only possessions of two shirts and a worn suit, and a tray displaying his numerous bottles of medications: chloral hydrate, opium, and barbiturates. Wrapped in his overcoat, his double glasses close to the paper, he wrote for hours, depressed, in pain, increasingly blind, and isolated.1\n",
    "\n",
    "We learn from ‚ÄúNietzsche: in Illness and in Health‚Äù by William Gass that Nietzsche had been troubled by ill health most of his life.2 He had hemorrhoids and suffered from ‚Äúgastric spasms.‚Äù He had bad eyesight, often fainted, had fits, and was scared of lightning, which made him hide under the covers. He sometimes vomited blood, for which he was given quinine. He followed prescribed diets seriously, ate only small pieces of meat with Carlsbad fruit salts, but changed his diets and physicians frequently. In the morning he had ‚Äúhis rectum flushed out with cold water.‚Äù He was treated with leeches applied to his ears, and these apparently partook of his blood while he partook of his wine.2 \n",
    "\n",
    "Nietzsche had suffered from migraines since he was nine years old. These were recurrent, severe, not preceded by auras, mostly localized to the right side, and often lasted several hours or even days.3 Visual problems began at age twelve, when he complained of tired eyes, and later of diminished vision. Later he was found to be blind in the right eye, and by 1878 he was almost completely blind. Depressive symptoms with suicidal ideas first appeared in 1882, followed by visual hallucinations (1884). The final breakdown occurred in Turin in 1889. There are several versions of this story, the most common being that he saw a man flogging his horse, rushed to him to stop him, collapsed, and was found hanging onto the horse‚Äôs neck.\n",
    "\n",
    "He was taken to a psychiatric clinic or asylum in Basel, where general paresis of the insane, quaternary neurosyphilis, was diagnosed. For the next decade, he remained in a bedridden vegetative state, insane and at times unmanageable. He had a series of strokes leading to impaired speech, facial paresis, and later a left-sided hemiplegia. He was cared for by his proto-fascist sister, who returned from South America and elaborated aspects of his philosophy that he had never expounded. He died in 1900 from pneumonia.\n",
    "\n",
    "It had long been thought that Nietzsche had suffered from neurosyphilis, general paresis of the insane, but several authorities have now disputed this diagnosis.3-6 Interestingly, the asymmetry of his pupils, an important sign of neurosyphilis, had been noted forty years earlier but was assumed to be a new finding. Other proposed causes of Nietzsche‚Äôs disease are meningioma, bipolar affective disorder followed by vascular dementia, a hereditary form of frontotemporal dementia, or mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), a disease presenting with stroke-like episodes, epilepsy, and neurologic deficits.4,5\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2008 neurologists from Ghent in Belgium carried out an extensive and meticulous review of original medical notes and other documents, mostly in German, and renewed their opinion that the clinical picture was not consistent with neurosyphilis. Instead, they proposed that Nietzsche had suffered the newly described neurological syndrome of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy or CADASIL.3 This inherited disease of blood vessels has been found to affect mainly the blood vessels supplying the white matter of the brain. In support of their diagnosis, they pointed out that Nietzsche‚Äôs father Ludwig had suffered from an illness running a similar course, with aphasia, multiple strokes, and dementia, becoming incapacitated and dying at age forty-six from ‚Äúbrain softening.‚Äù One younger brother also had migraines, suggesting this was a hereditary disease.3\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, the cause of Nietzsche‚Äôs death remains uncertain. It has been suggested that it could be established by an exhumation of the body and DNA testing on tissue and looking for skull imprints that would confirm the presence of a tumor.6 Some authors still favor an atypical form of syphilis as the most likely diagnosis.6 When all is said and done we may never know what killed this remarkable person. But more than a century later people still read him, and academicians argue about what he really meant. And for most of his readers, he remains stimulating, controversial, provocative, and fun to read.\n",

    "To compete with contemporary popular musicians such as the Beatles and Bob Dylan, Campus Crusade sponsored its own Christian popular music band called the New Folk. According to historian John G. Turner, Campus Crusade under Bright's leadership also actively sought to confront the counterculture movement during the 1960s and 1970s. One notable Campus Crusade campaign was the \"Berkeley Blitz\" in January 1967 which saw 600 Campus Crusade staff and students organize a series of events including concerts, dinners for international students, a performance by the illusionist Andr√© Kole, and a sermon by evangelist Billy Graham. Campus Crusade also claimed to have converted 700 students and faculty members  \n",

    "In 1972, Campus Crusade in coordination with the Jesus Movement organized a week-long International Student Congress on Evangelism at Cotton Bowl Stadium in Dallas known as Explo '72. The Explo '72 conference featured evangelism and discipleship training and contemporary music events. It was attended by 80,000 college and high school students and was nicknamed as the \"Christian Woodstock\" in the media. Besides Billy Graham, the event featured several contemporary popular musicians including Johnny Cash, Kris Kristofferson, the Christian band Love Song, \\textcolor{blue}{Andra√© Crouch}, and the Disciples  \n",
    "\n",
    "During the 1980s, Campus Crusade increased its cooperation with the charismatic, Pentecostal, and Catholic churches and denominations. Bright's personal friendships with charismatic and Pentecostal Christians and Zachary Bright's charismatic experience led Campus Crusade to soften its stance towards charismatic and Pentecostal churches. In 1983, Campus Crusade overturned its ban on staff members speaking in tongues. During the late 1980s, Campus Crusade also partnered with the Assemblies of God in missionary work in [Africa](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-01-04-me-24254-story.html) and Latin America. In addition, Campus Crusade also collaborated with the Catholic Church to distribute the Jesus film in Catholic countries   \n",

    "\n",
    "Last week, Bernie Madoff, (pronounced ‚Äúmade off‚Äù as in ‚Äúmade off with all your money‚Äù) died in prison. He was serving a 150-year term for defrauding thousands of people of as much as $65 billion dollars. He was a young 82 and had served only 12 years of the 150-year sentence. No word yet on who will cover the other 138 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among his famous clueless victims were the brilliant director and filmmaker Steven Spielberg, the brilliant actor Kevin Bacon and the brilliant Hall of Fame pitcher Sandy Koufax. Which in retrospect doesn‚Äôt make them look so brilliant after all.\n",
    "One actually brilliant man, independent investigator Harry Markopolos, smelled a rat as early as 2000, but was unable to convince anyone that Madoff was a fake, because nobody could hear him over the loud party music investors were playing as they were celebrating their improbable returns on their investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might ask how he was able to hoodwink so many people for so long. That‚Äôs easy. He simply used a version of the well-known pyramid scheme, which was invented in Egypt. That‚Äôs where the top man, Madoff in this case, proposes to build a pyramid made out of other people‚Äôs money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Madoff, acting as the pharaoh, convinces all the gullible people he can to fork over their hard earned cash in return for a piece of the pie, I mean, ‚Äúpyramid‚Äù.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more people foolishly hand over their money, the more the pharaoh tells them how brilliant they are to be investing in his pyramid. This only makes the people want to question him less and fork over even more money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because pyramid schemes (being made of money, not mortar and bricks) are naturally flawed, his pyramid eventually collapsed to the ultimate horror of the investors and building inspectors but mostly to the horror of the Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC. \n",
    "That‚Äôs the highly financed, watchdog government agency designed to protect us hard-working taxpayers from people like Mr. Madoff, but which was obviously asleep at the wheel.\n",
    "So how silly does that make the SEC look? I think the SEC ranks just above FEMA in terms of likeability of government agencies designed to help us. That‚Äôs how.\n",
    "\n",
    "What Madoff was doing was closer to what‚Äôs called a Ponzi scheme. It convinces people to invest their money blindly and can maintain the illusion of a sustainable investment vehicle as long as new people contribute new funds, and as long as those investing do not ask full repayment and still believe in the non-existent assets they supposedly are entitled to. This incidentally sounds just like our Social Security system. Just giving you fair warning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the meantime, just be wary of any investors with get-rich-quick schemes involving three-dimensional objects like pyramids, cubes, cones or arches. Always ask to see the building permit first.\n",

    "This is how: from a consummate reggae song by Andráe (Marvelous), my craving for reggae wanted fulfillment. And so I purchased Bob Marley's complete discography. And now I've discovered a song in his 124 song collection (Exodus, in which Bob Marley says \"we are going to our fathers land, movement of Jah people) which recalled Lucky Dube's music (House of Exile, Back to My root, but specifically the Ugandan hit song \"Feel Irie\").  \n",
    "   \n",
    "And so this led me to Wikipedia to look for connections, patterns, between Bob Marley's and Lucky Dube's Lamentations. And what did I find? This paragraph, \"Lucky Dube is considered to be especially remarkable as a Dub Artist due to his lack of a diasporas cultural base. This was particularly due to the nature of Reggae and Dub being a platform for expression of displacement from the homeland. In Prisoner, the South African artist makes the genre his own by applying themes of apartheid and internal displacement... He was revolutionary in so far as he introduced a competing version of Raggae's constant tendency of `romanticizing the utopian homeland of Africa`.\"  \n",

    "My dear, I'm still listening to Marley's Exodus  (1977) on loop, but in turn with Lucky Dube's Feel Irie (1994ish). Looks like Dube copied and pasted half of the music from Exodus to make an even better song!   \n",

    "I want to travel in Europe, Alyosha, I shall set off from here. And yet I know that I am only going to a graveyard, but it's a most precious graveyard, that's what it is! Precious are the dead that lie there, every stone over them speaks of such burning life in the past, of such passionate faith in their work, their truth, their struggle and their science, that I know I shall fall on the ground and kiss those stones and weep over them; though I'm convinced in my heart that it's long been nothing but a graveyard. And I shall not weep from despair, but simply because I shall be happy in my tears, I shall steep my soul in emotion. I love the sticky leaves in spring, the blue sky- that's all it is. It's not a matter of intellect or logic, it's loving with one's inside, with one's stomach. One loves the first strength of one's youth. Do you understand anything of my tirade, Alyosha?    \n",

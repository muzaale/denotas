Yet I have never looked upon either of them with anything short of deep respect. Even in their tragedy, these men are beautiful to me.

    "Nietzsche was no stranger to the virtues of music. Among his most oft-quoted words are: “Life without music would be an error,” and “I would not know what the spirit of a philosopher might wish more to be than a good dancer”.3 Nietzsche, from his earliest writings, considered himself a disciple of Dionysus, the ancient Greek God of pleasure. To Nietzsche, Dionysus symbolized everything ecstatic, exuberant, and rich with life. “In the Dionysian symbol,” he wrote, “there is attained the extreme limit of affirmation.” He adored art which embodied this attitude, principally music, which speaks to the emotions on a particularly instinctual level. Perhaps due to this fact, Nietzsche himself attached a great deal of personal importance to his own musical compositions.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Though considered to be mediocre at best as a composer, he was extremely concerned with the public’s reception of his work. In a letter to his friend Peter Gast in 1882 regarding his orchestral piece “Hymn to Life”, he wrote: “This time, ‘music’ is coming to you. I would hope that I have made a song that could be performed publicly — in order to seduce people to my philosophy”.4 As a musician himself, Nietzsche recognized music’s particular magic, and saw it as a complement to his philosophy which could expand his public influence.   \n",
    "\n",
    "While Nietzsche, the frustrated composer, never received much respect for his music, he did create something else relatively seductive: a piece of writing that is much closer to poetry or music than it is to analytic philosophy. It is Thus Spoke Zarathustra, perhaps his most popular yet most puzzling work of philosophy, composed between 1883 and 1885. It reads like a work of literature, telling the story of a solitary prophet named Zarathustra who emerges from his seclusion to spread his wisdom. Through a series of parables, Nietzsche leads us on a densely symbolic and ecstatic tour of his philosophical views which stands in contrast to his other work; despite his proclivity to speak in aphorisms (Beyond Good and Evil, Twilight of the Idols), Nietzsche’s canon arguably consists of relatively linear works of philosophy. Nowhere else do we find an extended metaphorical narrative within his work akin to Zarathustra. We’ll call Zarathustra, for our purposes here, Nietzsche’s closest approximation to a pop song. It is with a focus on Zarathustra that I begin his comparison with Michael Jackson — with artist speaking to artist, both expressing their philosophies with all the grace and mystique of a great dancer, through shared virtue and shared tragedy.   \n",

    "Today we had a question about the interpretation of the pdf. Consider the case when we have a random variable $X$ with pdf $f(x)$. Note that the pdf, $f(x)$, is the derivative of the cdf, $F(x)$. Assume that we are in a small interval $[x_1,x_2]$. Then in this interval $f(x_1)$ is approximated by $\\{F(x_2)-F(x_1)\\}/(x_2-x_1)$\n",
    "The numerator in this formula is $F(x_2)-F(x_1)$, which is equal to $P(X\\in [x_1,x_2])$. This probability can be estimated by the proportion of observations that fall in the interval $[x_1,x_2]$ and is a number between 0 and 1. However, this probability is divided by the length of the interval $[x_1,x_2]$, that is $x_2-x_1$. The ratio between the frequency of observations in the interval $[x_1,x_2]$ and the length of the interval $[x_1,x_2]$ is not guaranteed to be between 0 and 1. In fact, it can be any number between 0 and infinity.   \n",

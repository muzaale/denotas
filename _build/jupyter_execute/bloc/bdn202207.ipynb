    "— Mulago is designated as the pioneer transplant center\n",
    "— This is a false start and should strongly be discouraged\n",
    "— Because Transplantation at its core is all about logistics\n",
    "— With resources that can’t be concentrated in Kampala\n",
    "— Such as deceased donor organ at a given time\n",
    "— And the most compatible match for that deceased donor organ\n",
    "— Only nationwide registries at OPO level would minimize asymmetries of info\n",
    "— Reminder: post-transplant care must be de-centralized to ensure lifetime access\n",
    "— Can’t see how designating a pioneer center helps this cause\n",
    "— Stifles innovation and merely delays progress\n",

    "— All medical centers should be represented in the Council\n",
    "— Only those doing transplants may be voting members\n",
    "— Ensures transparency of process towards membership\n",
    "— Criteria for membership should be open, automatic and not for Minister to interpret \n",
    "\n",
    "30.Qualification for designation as transplant center\n",
    "— Two adjacent theaters; one for the donor and another for the recipient. Only necessary in the case of living donor transplantation, and only if the donor is in the same hospital\n",
    "— Deceased donor transplantation never has such needs as organ harvesting or procurement is performed at the center where the donor was declared brain dead. This site is almost certainly never the same as the recipient center, since there is a waitlist and also HLA-compatibility issues that often lead to the logistical necessity of transporting a procured organ from one center to another \n",
    "— Living donor transplantation on the other hand is often performed in two adjacent theaters. As such, this item uncovers unstated assumptions about deceased donor vs. living donor transplantation across the entire bill. These should be explicitly stated at the outset!\n",
    "\n",
    "31.Designation by Minister\n",
    "— There shouldn’t be any role for Minister in designating a hospital a transplant centers\n",
    "— Open and transparent criteria are sufficient \n",
    "— As such a hospital should automatically be considered eligible once it meets these\n",
    "— Center should then be invited to (or should itself)) submit the application\n",
    "— It should expect to be granted status unless criteria insufficient \n",
    "— Process should be open to both voting and non-voting members\n",
    "— (6) A hospital seeking to be designated to undertake cadaveric transplantation shall be required to get additional approval. Cadaveric is an out-of-fashion term. We now say Deceased donor transplantation. Also, this statement once again tells us that the unstated assumption is that living donor transplantation is the default mode where no adjective such as deceased donor is used. I believe this makes the bill vague and poorly worded and should be revised in its entirely to make the distinction between living donor and deceased donor transplantation from the outset. \n",
    "\n",
    "32.Existing centers\n",

    "— The case for tissues and cells is different and this should be made clear\n",
    "\n",
    "37.Education services to the public\n",
    "— (4) Every designated transplant center shall produce or have available literature and media items that provide education and awareness creation for donation of organs, tissues, and cells\n",
    "— For any of the outlined issues to be empirically based (i.e., scientific), Transplant centers will have to derived from peer-reviewed research. This item is lacking from the bill\n",
    "— I propose that the database that is established for regulatory purposes should not only be used to ensure traceability of organs and prevent trafficking, but also be put to use in registry-based research with annual reports published in a peer-reviewed journal such as Makerere’s African Journal of Health Sciences \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "— Non-designated transplant centers and academic institutions should have access to registry data for research purposes. These data may be de-identified to comply with patient privacy\n",
    "\n",
    "Part VI.\n",
    "40.Organ Donation and Transport Quality Control System\n",
    "(e) a database for all potential recipients and donors. I propose the name Uganda Network for Organ Sharing — UNOS. This serves as a reminder that the designation of Mulago as the pioneer center is misguided and potentially harmful to innovation and growth of a truly de-centralized network of organ sharing. \n",
    "\n",
    "41.Quality assurance programmes\n",
    "Internal audit or risk management. A competitive contract may be issued to academic or statistical agencies, carrying the name SRTR — Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. This registry will obtain regulatory and administrative data from UNOS and use it to quantify clinical outcomes such as death while on the waitlist, time from waitlist to transplant, allograft failure after transplant, immunosuppressive therapy used after transplant, primary graft non-function, survival after transplant, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "The SRTR will produce annual peer-reviewed publications that summarize key metrics. However, the SRTR should also make its data available to third-parties, who may also use it for academic and peer-reviewed research. \n",

    "Only such an arrangement will ensure transparency, high quality appraisal of clinical outcomes, and center-level performance compared with the national average or some such benchmark. \n",
    "\n",
    "45.Preservation of organs, tissues and cells.\n",
    "— This may only apply to tissues and cells, never to organs!\n",
    "\n",
    "48.Review of donor medical information\n",
    "— Prior to the distribution of any organ, tissue or cell for transplantation, the registered medical practiional of a bank… \n",
    "— In the case of living donor transplantation, this is meaningless since the donated organ will be in an adjacent operating theater to the one of the recipient\n",
    "— So this mostly applies to deceased donor transplantation. As such, the entire bill remains somewhat confused about this distinction, which is not made at the outset. \n",
    "\n",
    "PART VIII.\n",
    "52.National waiting list\n",
    "— Every patient indicated for organ transplant should be registered on the deceased donor waiting list\n",
    "— However some registrants may proceed to living donor transplantation \n",
    "— Thereafter they’ll be removed from the waiting list\n",
    "\n",
    "53.Fair and equitable system.\n",
    "— (5) Access to organs, cells and tissues shall be provided without regard to recipient sex, age, religion, race, creed, color or financial standing\n",
    "— What about nationality?\n",
    "\n",
    "54.Transplantation activity.\n",
    "— (1) The retrieval and preservation of human organs…\n",
    "— Lets be consistent with terms used\n",
    "— Internationally, the term used is “The procurement… of human organs”\n",
    "\n",
    "— (5) When a person has been confirmed brain dead by the team in care, the Council shall immediately be notified to send an independent neurological team to confirm the death for purposes of donation. \n",
    "— This, again, only applies to deceased donor transplantation\n",
    "— And this activity is not practical. An EEG is the standard way to define brain death and that can be electronically documented for the team at the local hospital. The patients relatives can review the evidence even without training (the local neurological team may explain the technical details)\n",
    "— Family reserve the right to refuse to offer their loved ones body organs for transplantation\n",
    "\n",
    "60.Preservation for transplantation\n",
    "— (1) Where part of the body of a brain-dead person in a hospital, nursing home or other institution is or may be suitable for use for translation, the hospital, nursing home or institution shall preserve the body and transfer it to a designated transplant center for harvesting in accordance with this Act\n",
    "— This may be prohibitively expensive. Typically a team of surgeons is sent to harvest the organs at the center where brain-death is declared. Only the organ is transported to the recipient hospital. This is cheaper and more cost-effective\n",
    "— It is also logistically more meaningful since several organs may be procured from one deceased donor and the recipient hospitals for the various organs are unlikely to be the same since a waitlist is defined organ by organ\n",
    "\n",
    "61.Harvesting of organs, tissues and cells\n",
    "— Lets use the term procurement of organs\n",

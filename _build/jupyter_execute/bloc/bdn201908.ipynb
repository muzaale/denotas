    "“Multiple flavors of his city” is the key here. From introspection, I have come to appreciate just how much these flâneur traits dominate my thinking about clinical medicine, tradition, and ‘best practice guidelines’. I instinctively have issues with best practice guidelines - typically a kind of “single” narrative or algorithm. Always have and this caused me some trouble in med school and adversely affected my grades. But it’s the same stuff that drives my research, which has already overturned orthodoxies — and will continue to. It’s a kind of investigate journalism. A useful fourth estate. A thorn in the flesh of anyone in authority. Uganda needs me as an irreverent journalist 🇺🇬 :-)  \n",

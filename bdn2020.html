Why thinkers of every political persuasion keep finding inspiration in the philosopher.

It takes a strong philosopher to assume control of a preposition and propel it into a foreign language. That is what Friedrich Nietzsche did with the word über. In German, it can mean “over,” “beyond,” or “about.” You are reading an essay über Nietzsche. As a prefix, über is sometimes equivalent to the English “super”—übernatürlich is “supernatural”—but it has less of an aggrandizing effect. Nietzsche altered the destiny of the word when, in the eighteen-eighties, he began speaking of the Übermensch, which has been translated as “superman,” “superhuman,” and “overman.” Scholars still debate what Nietzsche had in mind. A physically stronger being? A spiritual aristocrat? A kind of cyborg? “Overperson” might be the most literal equivalent in English, although it is unlikely that DC Comics would have sold many comic books using that title.

In 1903, three years after Nietzsche’s death, George Bernard Shaw published his play “Man and Superman,” in which he equated the Übermensch with an overflowing “Life Force.” Three decades later, Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster, two Cleveland teen-agers, created the first “Super-Man” story, depicting the character not as a caped hero but as a bald, telepathic villain bent on “total annihilation.” Super-Man soon reëmerged as a muscle-bound defender of the good, and during the Second World War he jumped into the fight against the Nazis. It’s unclear whether Siegel and Shuster knew of Nietzsche in 1933, but the word “superman” hardly existed in English before the philosopher’s ideas began to spread.

As Nietzsche worked his wiles on generations of English-speaking college students, the word Übermensch increasingly stood on its own, and “über” slipped into English as a prefix. In the nineteen-eighties, Spy described the Hollywood agent Michael Ovitz as an “über-agent.” The umlaut-free car-sharing service Uber, originally known as UberCab, is a related development, hinting at Silicon Valley fantasies of world domination. In the late twentieth century, the word “super” rebounded into German as all-purpose slang for “very”; if you wish to describe something as really, really cool, you say that it is super super toll. Somewhere, Nietzsche is laughing hysterically while screaming in anguish.

The adventures of “super” and “über” are a case study in the inescapability of Nietzsche’s philosophy, which has affected everyday discourse and modern political reality like no body of thought before it. Countless books on Nietzsche are published in dozens of languages each year, linking him to every imaginable zone of life and culture. One can read about the French Nietzsche, the American Nietzsche, the pragmatic Nietzsche, the analytic Nietzsche, the feminist Nietzsche, the gay Nietzsche, the black Nietzsche, the environmentalist Nietzsche. 

Lurking amid the crowd of avatars is the proto-fascist Nietzsche—the proponent of pitilessness, hardness, and the will to power who is cited approvingly by such far-right gurus as Alain de Benoist, Richard Spencer, and Aleksandr Dugin. Can a philosopher who has sown such confusion be said to possess a coherent identity? Or, as Bertrand Russell once argued, is Nietzsche merely a literary phenomenon?

When I was in college, in the nineteen-eighties, the French Nietzsche held sway. It was the heyday of post-structuralism, and Nietzsche appeared to anticipate one of the central insights of that era: that we are at the mercy of ever-shifting systems and perspectives. The work of Michel Foucault, Gilles Deleuze, and Jacques Derrida is all but inconceivable without Nietzsche’s example. So many professors distributed photocopies of the 1873 essay “On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense” that we could have recited it as a postmodern pledge of allegiance: 

“What, then, is truth? A mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms. . . . Truths are illusions about which one has forgotten that this is what they are.”

In the past few decades, other Nietzsches have come to the fore. Anglo-American philosophers have aligned him with various schools of post-analytic thought, seeing him as an idiosyncratic kind of psychologist or sociologist. Nietzsche’s political thinking is also a trending topic, although his ideas are devilishly difficult to reconcile with modern conceptions of left and right. He raged against democracy and egalitarianism, but also against nationalism and anti-Semitism. Nietzsche is often quoted in the chat rooms of the far right, and he also surfaces regularly in leftist discussions about the future of democracy.

Walter Kaufmann, the German-American émigré whose translations of Nietzsche were long the standard versions in English, once declared that the philosopher’s writings are “easier to read but harder to understand than those of almost any other thinker.” Ideologues keep trying to appropriate him because they want his rhetorical firepower on their side. Yet Nietzsche, like his fallen idol Richard Wagner, is at once emphatic and ambiguous, overbearing and elusive. Nietzsche’s famous adage that there are “no facts, only interpretations” is among his more debatable propositions, but it applies perfectly well to his own infuriating, invigorating body of work.

The itinerant, solitary, sickly life of Nietzsche has been told many times, most recently in English by the biographer Sue Prideaux, in “I Am Dynamite!” The title comes from an unnerving passage in “Ecce Homo,” Nietzsche’s autobiographical book of 1888, which was completed a couple of months before he descended into insanity, at the age of forty-four:
I know my lot. One day my name will be linked to the memory of something monstrous [etwas Ungeheueres]—to a crisis like none there has been on earth, to the most profound collision of conscience, to a verdict invoked against everything that until then had been believed, demanded, held sacred. I am no man, I am dynamite.

How a Lutheran pastor’s son, trained in classical philology, ended up on that precipice of brilliance and madness is the essential drama of Nietzsche’s life. The passage has been read as an eerie premonition of his future appropriation by the Nazis—although there is no way of knowing exactly what kind of crisis is meant. Ungeheuer is an ambiguous word, hovering between the monstrous and the gigantic. Kaufmann translated it as “tremendous,” which takes away too much of the ominousness. Here is the sumptuous difficulty of Nietzsche: when you drill down on a word, an abyss of interpretation opens.

Nietzsche grew up in the village of Röcken, outside Leipzig. The church where his father preached still stands; Nietzsche, the scourge of Christianity, is buried in a plot next to the building. The elder Nietzsche, like his son, was afflicted by severe physical and mental problems—violent headaches, epileptic strokes, amnesiac episodes—and died at the age of thirty-five, when Friedrich was four. Nietzsche himself had a mental breakdown in middle age. The old story that his breakdown stemmed from syphilis is now widely doubted; a likelier explanation is a hereditary neurological or vascular disorder. Neurologists in Belgium and Switzerland have concluded that he had cadasil, a genetic condition that causes repeated strokes.

“I Am Dynamite!” lacks the philosophical scope of prior biographies by Rüdiger Safranski and Julian Young, but Prideaux is a stylish and witty narrator. She begins with the pivotal event in Nietzsche’s life: his introduction, in 1868, to Wagner, the most consequential German cultural figure of the day. Nietzsche would soon assume a professorship in Basel, at the astonishingly young age of twenty-four, but he jumped at the chance to join the Wagner operation. For the next eight years, as Wagner completed his operatic cycle “The Ring of the Nibelung” and prepared for its première, Nietzsche served as a propagandist for the Wagnerian cause and as the Meister’s factotum. He then broke away, declaring his intellectual independence first with coded critiques and then with unabashed polemics. Accounts of this immensely complicated relationship are too often distorted by prejudice on one side or another. Nietzscheans and Wagnerians both tend to off-load ideological problems onto the rival camp; Prideaux succumbs to this temptation. She insists that Nietzsche’s talk of a superior brood of “blond beasts” has no modern racial connotation, and casts Wagner’s Siegfried as an Aryan hero who “rides to the redemption of the world.” In fact, Siegfried is a fallen hero who rides nowhere; the redeemer of the world is Brünnhilde.

Prideaux’s picture of the Wagner-Nietzsche relationship fails to explain either the intensity of their bond or the trauma of their break. Early on, Nietzsche was hopelessly infatuated with Wagner’s music and personality. He described the friendship as “my only love affair.” As with many infatuations, Nietzsche’s expectations were wildly exaggerated. He hoped that the “Ring” would revive the cultural paradise of ancient Greece, fusing Apollonian beauty and Dionysian savagery. He envisaged an audience of élite aesthetes who would carry a transfiguring message to the outer world. Wagner, too, revered Greek culture, but he was fundamentally a man of the theatre, and tailored his ideals to the realities of the stage. At the first Bayreuth Festival, in 1876, Nietzsche was crestfallen to discover that a viable theatre operation required the patronage of the nouveau riche and the fashionable.

Personal differences between the two men provide amusing anecdotes. Nietzsche made sporadic attempts at musical composition, one of which caused Wagner to have a laughing fit. (The music is not very good, but it is not as bad as all that.) Wagner also suggested to Nietzsche’s doctor that the young man’s medical issues were the result of excessive masturbation. But the disagreements went much deeper, revealing a rift between ideologies and epochs. Wagner embodied the nineteenth century, in all its grandeur and delusion; Nietzsche was the dynamic, destructive torchbearer of the twentieth.

When they first met, they shared an admiration for the philosophical pessimism of Arthur Schopenhauer, who saw a world governed by the insatiable striving of the will. Only through the renunciation of worldly desire, Schopenhauer posited, can we free ourselves from our incessant drives. Aesthetic experience is one avenue to self-overcoming—an idea that the art-besotted Nietzsche seized upon. But he disdained Schopenhauer’s emphasis on the practice of compassion, which also promises release from the grasping ego. Wagner, by contrast, claimed to value compassion above all other emotions. “Parsifal,” his final opera, has as its motto “Durch Mitleid wissend, der reine Tor” (“The pure fool, knowing through pity”). Nietzsche’s 1878 book, “Human, All Too Human,” his inaugural assault on Wagner and Romantic metaphysics, hammers away at the word Mitleid, considering it an instrument of weakness. In its place, Nietzsche praises hardness, force, cruelty. “Culture simply cannot do without passions, vices, and acts of malice,” he writes.

These views made Wagner wince, as the diaries of Cosima Wagner, his wife, attest. In an earlier essay entitled “The Greek State,” Nietzsche had declared that “slavery belongs to the essence of a culture.” The intellectual historian Martin Ruehl speculates that Wagner persuaded Nietzsche to omit the essay from his first book, “The Birth of Tragedy Out of the Spirit of Music” (1872), which culminates in a paean to Wagner. During the same period, though, Nietzsche was castigating German tendencies toward nationalist chauvinism and anti-Semitism—conspicuous elements in Wagner’s political blatherings. What seems particularly unfortunate about the break is that each man had an acute sense of the other’s blindnesses.

Nietzsche not only rejected the sublime longings of nineteenth-century Romanticism; he also jettisoned the teleology of historical progress that had governed European thought since the Renaissance, and that had found its most formidable advocate in Hegel. Instead, Nietzsche grounded himself in a version of naturalism—the post-Darwinian conviction that humans are an animal species, led by no transcendent purpose. This turn yields Nietzsche’s most controversial concepts: the announcement of the death of God; the “eternal return,” which frames existence in terms of endlessly repeating cycles; and the will to power, which involves a ceaseless struggle for survival and mastery. It might be said that Nietzsche, in backing away from Wagner, backed into his own mature thought—the celebration of Dionysian energy, the “triumphal yes to life over and above all death and change.”

Between his final meeting with Wagner, in 1876, and his mental collapse of 1889, Nietzsche lived the life of an intellectual ascetic. Health problems caused him to resign his professorship in 1879; from then on, he adopted a nomadic life style, summering in the Swiss Alps and wintering, variously, in Genoa, Rapallo, Venice, Nice, and Turin. He wrote a dozen books, of increasingly idiosyncratic character, poised between philosophy, aphoristic cultural criticism, polemic, and autobiography. He worked out many of his ideas during vigorous Alpine hikes—a practice fondly re-created by John Kaag in the recent book “Hiking with Nietzsche.” The possibility of a romance with the psychologist Lou Andreas-Salomé arose and then subsided; a serious relationship was probably beyond his reach. The landscape of the mind consumed his attention. As Safranski wrote, “For Nietzsche, thinking was an act of extreme emotional intensity. He thought the way others feel.”

Translating Nietzsche is a difficult task, but the swagger of his prose, with its pithy strikes and sudden swerves, can be fairly readily approximated in English. Kaufmann, in his translations, brought to bear a strong, pugnacious style. In his introductions and footnotes, he distanced Nietzsche from fascist bombast—naming the Übermensch the “Overman” was just one strategy—and recast him as a kind of existentialist. But Kaufmann underplayed Nietzsche’s slippery elegance, and his choice not to translate “Human, All Too Human” and its successor, “Dawn” (1881), gave a skewed view of the thinker’s development. A series of translations from Cambridge University Press covered the gaps. Now Stanford University Press is halfway through a nineteen-volume edition of Nietzsche’s complete writings and notebooks. The press has been threatened with cuts in funding, but if the project is achieved English readers will have, for the first time, access to the entirety of Nietzsche’s work.

Since 1967, the German publisher De Gruyter has been amassing a critical edition of Nietzsche’s complete writings, which can be browsed on a dizzyingly comprehensive Web site, nietzschesource.org. This monumental project has, to the annoyance of some scholars, attracted increasing attention to Nietzsche’s extensive notebooks. These show a less awe-inspiring side of the philosopher, as he jots down items from his reading and delivers utterances esoteric, mundane, and bizarre:

When five people speak together, a sixth always has to die.
The Chinese eat very many dishes in very small portions.
I could become the European Buddha.
If you aren’t a bird, be careful not to camp above an abyss.
Woman is so little satisfied with herself that she would rather permit herself to be beaten than—
The last thought is left blessedly unfinished. Nietzsche’s misogyny is a brute fact that no pageant of interpretation can disguise.

Yet the notebooks contain some of Nietzsche’s most vital, pungent writing. Consider a remarkable passage from 1885, which appears in the most recent Stanford volume, “Unpublished Fragments (Spring 1885–Spring 1886),” in a translation by Adrian Del Caro. It has long been known to readers as the final section of “The Will to Power,” Nietzsche’s posthumous so-called magnum opus, assembled under the direction of his reactionary sister, Elisabeth Förster-Nietzsche, and published in 1901. To come across it in the Stanford edition, free of Förster-Nietzsche’s tendentious and often deceptive editorial practices, is a bracing shock:

And do you also know what “the world” is to me? Should I show it to you in my mirror? This world: a colossus [Ungeheuer] of energy, without beginning, without end, a firm, unshakable magnitude of energy that does not get bigger, does not get smaller, that does not expend itself but only transforms itself, as a whole unchangeable in size, an economy without expenditures and losses, but likewise without growth, without income, encased by “nothingness” as by its border, nothing blurring, wasted, nothing infinitely extended, but laid into a definite space as a definite force, and not a space that would be “empty” anywhere, rather as force everywhere, as play of forces and waves of forces . . . this my Dionysian world of eternal self-creating, of eternal self-destroying, this mystery-world of the doubly voluptuous, this my beyond good and evil, without goal, if a goal does not lie in the happiness of the circle, without will, if a ring does not have good will for itself—do you want a name for this world? A solution for all its riddles? a light for you too, you hiddenmost, strongest, most intrepid, most midnightly?—This world is the will to power—and nothing else! And you yourselves are also this will to power—and nothing else!

The central sentence actually goes on for almost twice as long, disrupting the rat-a-tat rhythm that is typical of Nietzsche’s later writing. He generally resisted the epic long-windedness of nineteenth-century German prose, but here he makes an exception as he verbally acts out the condition of universal flux. An additional wrinkle is that the diction begins to resemble the ecstatic love duets of Wagner’s “Tristan und Isolde” (“Without naming / Without parting / Newly knowing / Newly burning”). You could quibble with this or that choice in Del Caro’s rendering—the statuesque word “colossus” seems a poor choice for Ungeheuer—but the passage has the right racing, dancing energy.

No creature in Nietzsche’s menagerie of concepts has caused as much trouble as the will to power. At first glance, this entity strongly resembles Schopenhauer’s all-devouring will. For Martin Heidegger, the will to power was the last gasp of metaphysics—an attempt to capture the “basic character of all beings,” which Heidegger wishes to supplant with his post-metaphysical idea of being-in-the-world. Gilles Deleuze, the chief guru of the French Nietzsche, wrote, “The will to power is not force but the differential element which simultaneously determines the relations of forces (quantity) and the respective qualities of related forces.” One needn’t know exactly what Deleuze means here to accept the underlying proposition that Nietzsche understands power less as a struggle for domination over others than as a struggle for power over oneself. Rather than fleeing abjectly from the will, as in Schopenhauer, one should seek to harness it, master it, ride it out.

When Nietzsche revisits this material, in “Beyond Good and Evil” (1886), he pulls back abruptly, placing the will to power in a hypothetical, almost ironic frame. He begins, “Supposing nothing were ‘given’ as real besides our world of desires and passions . . .” After a series of qualifications, he concludes, “Supposing finally that we were to succeed in explaining our entire life of drives as the taking shape and ramification of a basic form of the will—namely of the will to power, as my proposition has it . . . then we would have earned the right to unequivocally determine all effective force as: will to power.” Nietzsche, for all his bravado, likes to hedge his bets, as Tom Stern points out in the introduction to “The New Cambridge Companion to Nietzsche.” He writes that the philosopher’s style is one of “rhetorical questions, ellipses, fables, mini-dialogues, hints that much is left unsaid, and apparent praise for seeming to be other than you are.”

This cyclone of nuance goes missing when we reduce Nietzsche to maxims. Nor should we try to extract a system that can be summarized on a chalkboard. Ultimately, his writing is a mode of criticism, of übersubjective intellectual reportage, grounded in extreme self-awareness. Freud is said to have commented that Nietzsche “had a more penetrating knowledge of himself than any other man who ever lived or was ever likely to live.”

Monsters lurk in the Nietzschean deep. It cannot be a random mishap that so many unpleasant people have taken pleasure in his work. None other than Jacques Derrida discouraged talk of “falsifications” of Nietzsche, fascist or otherwise. “One can’t falsify just anything,” Derrida wrote, with unaccustomed bluntness. (One can, in fact, falsify anything, as a glance at the morning paper shows, but the point holds.) However selective the Nazi appropriation of Nietzsche may have been, it replicated elements of his thought. He did write that equality is the “greatest of all lies,” and divided humanity into a hierarchy of the weak and the strong. Hans Stark, the head of the admissions detail at Auschwitz, had a sign over his desk reading “Mitleid ist Schwäche” (“Compassion Is Weakness”). This could be read as a crude condensation of Nietzsche’s diatribe against compassion in “The Antichrist.”

Ronald Beiner, in a new book entitled “Dangerous Minds: Nietzsche, Heidegger, and the Return of the Far Right,” claims that the resurgence of far-right political movements around the world is evidence of Nietzsche’s nefarious influence. His hostility to absolute truth, Beiner writes, has “left us vulnerable to harsh new ideologies that appear to regard respect for truth as a snare.” To be sure, a circuitous chain of connections is needed to get from “Thus Spake Zarathustra” and “Beyond Good and Evil” to Donald Trump’s ravings about “fake news” or the vicious fictions of Sandy Hook conspiracy theorists. Merely to announce a high regard for truth is no guarantee that truth will be uttered. Indeed, some of the most hideous acts in history have been committed by people who believe themselves to be in sole possession of absolute truth. In the American context, merchants of hatred hardly need to look to a nineteenth-century German philologist for inspiration: they can draw on older and deeper wells at home.

Beiner is right to urge latter-day interpreters to abandon talk of an apolitical Nietzsche, but he is arguing largely with a previous generation of scholars. There is no lack of contemporary publications that deal forthrightly with Nietzsche’s political thinking: these include Hugo Drochon’s “Nietzsche’s Great Politics,” Tamsin Shaw’s “Nietzsche’s Political Skepticism,” and Gary Shapiro’s “Nietzsche’s Earth: Great Events, Great Politics.” Stern catalogues Nietzsche’s most problematic traits in the “Cambridge Companion,” although he adds the caveat that “we must have more categories available to us than ‘Nazi/not-Nazi,’ ‘anti-Semite/anti-anti-Semite,’ ‘far-sighted/foolish’ or ‘to be attacked/defended at all costs.’ ”

A recurring theme in these studies is that Nietzsche could be a fiercely prescient analyst of democratic politics, and that we can learn from his observations without following him into antidemocratic invective. In an essay in the “Cambridge Companion,” Christa Davis Acampora writes, “A popular view of Nietzsche regards him as an advocate of bald expressions of power, but he is better understood as someone who investigates—rather than celebrates—power.” Who can deny that human beings are a fundamentally predatory species, and that no political system or moral code has yet tamed our worst impulses? Nineteenth-century thinkers in the tradition of Hegel anticipated the attainment of a perfected state of humanity; instead, as Nietzsche foresaw, a century of unprecedented horrors ensued. During the Cold War, the powers that defeated fascism brought the world to the brink of a nuclear war that would have made the Second World War seem like a minor episode in comparison. Today, anthropogenic climate change is causing mass extinctions. To quote Zarathustra: “The Earth has a skin, and this skin has diseases. One of these diseases is called, for example, ‘humanity.’ ”

Nietzsche’s central insight about the modern state—one that greatly influenced the sociology of Max Weber and the political thinking of Carl Schmitt—is that it faces a crisis of authority. When power is no longer divinely ordained, the right to govern is contested. In “Human, All Too Human,” Nietzsche predicted that, as the democratic state secularized itself, there would be a surge of religious fanaticism resistant to centralized government. On the other side, he anticipated a zealous adherence to the state on the part of nonbelievers. Religious forces might seize control again, engendering new forms of enlightened despotism—“perhaps less enlightened and more fearful than before.” These struggles could go on for a while, Nietzsche writes. In one long paragraph, he prophesies the history of the twentieth century, from fascism to theocracy.

To the opponents of democracy, Nietzsche says, in essence: Just wait. Liberal democracy will devour itself, creating conditions for authoritarian rule. Disorder and instability will sow distrust in politics itself. “Step by step, private companies will absorb the functions of the state,” Nietzsche writes. “Even the most tenacious remnants of the old work of governing (the activity, for example, that is supposed to protect private persons from one another) will finally be taken care of by private entrepreneurs.” The distinction between public and private spheres will disappear. The state will give way to the “liberation of the private person (I take care not to say: of the individual).”

And here we are, in the twenty-first-century world of laissez-faire economics and unregulated Big Tech monopolies. As the political philosopher Urs Marti has pointed out, Nietzsche sometimes sounds less like a proto-Nazi than like a neoliberal or a libertarian. A notebook entry from 1885-86 looks ahead to “a superior kind of human being that thanks to its preponderance of willing, knowing, wealth and influence, makes use of democratic Europe as its most pliable and flexible tool for taking the destinies of the earth in hand, for shaping ‘the human being’ itself as an artist would.” Silicon Valley tycoons strive to become just such übermenschlich innovators. The entrepreneur Peter Thiel, an avid reader of Nietzsche, says things like “I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.” In this light, Nietzsche’s opposition to nationalism and anti-Semitism looks less virtuous. For tech billionaires, national and racial hatreds are inconveniences; their authoritarianism wears a cosmopolitan face, promising frictionless commerce for all.

Is that what Nietzsche wants? His avoidance of the word “individual,” in favor of “private person,” suggests skepticism. And a crucial aspect of his world view militates against monopolistic power. In 1995, Lawrence Hatab published a fascinating book called “A Nietzschean Defense of Democracy,” which emphasizes the philosopher’s attachment to the Greek agon—competition among worthy adversaries, whether athletic or artistic. Hatab revisits that connection in an essay, in the “Cambridge Companion,” on the will to power. In Nietzsche’s reading, the Greek mentality abhorred the idea of an Alleinherrschaft, a “domination by one.” The Athenian institution of ostracism originated in the need to expel individuals who threatened the balance of power. As Hatab observes, the rite of the agon “rules out violence, because violence is actually an impulse to eliminate conflict by annihilating or incapacitating an opponent.” In “Ecce Homo,” Nietzsche writes, “I attack only a winner.” He goes after the most tyrannical, domineering forces—hence, his critiques of God and Wagner.

The relevance for the modern democratic state is clear. James Madison’s vision of constitutional checks and balances, of divided powers in equilibrium, is agonistic politics in action. When one entity gathers too much power, the system ceases to function. Nietzsche’s political philosophy would appear to hope for such an outcome, but in “Human, All Too Human” he performs a typical backtracking maneuver. Having forecast the death of the state, he adds, “To work toward the diffusion and realization of this idea is admittedly something else.” The enterprise could lead to “destructive experiments.” It is a good thing, then, that, in all likelihood, “the state will still persist for a good while yet.”

Behind Nietzsche’s array of extreme positions is a much less alarming belief: that the only healthy state for humanity is one in which rival perspectives vie with one another, with none gaining the upper hand. The same attitude governs his fundamental epistemological position about the nature of truth. Each competitor in the agon is expected to stake his or her claims on truth; Nietzsche advanced his own opinions with utmost vehemence. The ultimate truth is that no claim should achieve dominion over all others. As Richard Rorty maintained, Nietzsche can be understood as a particularly flamboyant kind of pragmatist. We don’t think of William James as a “dangerous mind,” and yet he, too, said, “Damn the Absolute!”

Whenever I feel bewildered by endless interpretive skirmishes over the philosophical Antichrist, I return to Alexander Nehamas’s “Nietzsche: Life as Literature,” which appeared in 1985 and retains a commanding place on the near-infinite Nietzsche bookshelf. Nehamas, a Greek-American thinker steeped in classical studies, essentially made a virtue of Bertrand Russell’s dismissal of Nietzsche. The contradictions in Nietzsche’s writings cohere, Nehamas writes, if we look at him as a literary figure who worked within a philosophical context, and who crafted a persona that functions as a literary character of novelistic complexity.

The disparity between the living Nietzsche and the written one was indeed drastic. He was a fragile, sensitive, gentle person with elegant manners, constantly striving to mask his inner turmoil and physical distress. He let his personal anguish be reflected in a universal predicament: how can we hold to our convictions in the face of chaos, conflict, decay, and death? The idea of the eternal return—the prospect of having to live one’s life over and over, every detail repeated, every pain alongside every joy—becomes all the more potent when one thinks about having to relive that life, to its terrible end.

Nietzsche remains a heroic figure in intellectual history because his lonely, desperate quest seems to join up with so many other expeditions of the mind and soul. Wherever you travel, in sunny climates or in the shadowlands, Nietzsche has gone before you. Such is the temper of what may be the most openhearted and unproblematic passage in all of his writings—the closing aphorism of “Dawn,” perhaps his most beautiful book:

All these bold birds who fly out into the wide, widest open—it is true! At some point they will not be able to fly any farther and will squat down on some pylon or sparse crag—and very grateful for this miserable accommodation to boot! But who would want to conclude from this that there was no longer a vast and prodigious trajectory ahead of them, that they had flown as far and wide as one could fly! All our great mentors and precursors have finally come to a stop, and it is hardly the noblest and most graceful of gestures with which fatigue comes to a stop: it will also happen to you and me! Of what concern, however, is that to you and me! Other birds will fly farther!

A conversation with Mr. Putin’s former high-school biology teacher, however, quickly made clear that, as a popular Russian saying goes, “hope dies last.” She remembered Mr. Putin as not only a diligent student but also an exceptional basketball player because “he was very tall.”

Russia under Mr. Putin still reminds him of a sci-fi movie exoskeleton: “Inside is sitting a small, weak and perhaps frightened person, but from the outside it looks terrifying.”

Russia’s economy is dwarfed by that of America’s, which is more than 10 times bigger in dollar terms; it is too small to make even a list of the top 10, and it grew by around just 1 percent this year. Nor does Russia pack much cultural punch beyond its borders, despite excelling in classical music, ballet and many other arts. South Korea, thanks to K-pop and its movies, has more reach.

Yet Russia has become a lodestar for autocrats and aspiring autocrats around the world, a pioneer of the media and other tools — known in Russia as “political technologies” — that these leaders now deploy, with or without Moscow’s help, to disrupt a world order once dominated by the United States. These include the propagation of fake or at least highly misleading news; the masking of simple facts with complicated conspiracy theories; and denunciations of political rivals as traitors or, in a term President Trump borrowed from Stalin, “enemies of the people.”

The result is a state of fretful and anything-goes uncertainty, a condition summed up by Peter Pomerantsev, a Soviet-born British author, in the title of his 2014 book about Mr. Putin’s Russia: “Nothing is True and Everything is Possible.”

In Russia, Ms. Khrushcheva said, “it’s not what is on the surface, it’s doublespeak, triple-think. That’s why we are so good at art.”

BOOK CHAPTER
Introduction
Although the most important goals of donor evaluation are to identify donors with kidney disease that would preclude donation, eliminate the potential transfer of infection/cancer, and ensure there is no coercion, standard donor evaluation is hinged on excluding candidates who are at high risk for ESKD based on clinical risk factors such as age, sex, race, hyperglycemia, high blood pressure, proteinuria, GFR, BMI, and smoking history (Grams NEJM 2016, Lentine TPA 2017). To this end, online risk calculators endorsed by the 2017 KDIGO guidelines are used across the world by providers to help guide potential living kidney donors towards an empirically-based and shared decision-making process. But current clinical practice guidelines and all the available online risk calculators do not account for perioperative risks or other risk-factors, such as biological relationship of the donor to the recipient, that are strongly linked to long-term risks. 

Perioperative risk
The risks to the donor in the first 90 days of nephrectomy range from the minor to the adverse and are viewed with different emphases by donors, recipients, and transplant professionals. 

Long-term risk
Prior to 2014, all studies that investigated the long-term risk associated with living donation used the general population as a reference when assessing donor risk.

Communicating about risk
In 2016, Grams and colleagues ushered-in the era of web-based technology to facilitate dialogue between providers and potential donors about the implications of donor nephrectomy with regard to the subsequent risk of developed ESKD.

Summary
Truly individualized risk assessment for potential live kidney donors might never be realized. Available online risk calculators are too optimistic about our ability to distinguish the long-term risks faced by, say, a 25yo African American male donating to a full-sibling vs. a 25yo African American male donating to a biologically unrelated recipient (a 25-fold difference in risk might separate these two otherwise “comparable” scenarios.

As he picked himself up, Mr Li asked himself where all the money that had poured into jds had gone. Had it really just evaporated? He decided that, in fact, the apparent financial destruction of the company was what physicists call a phase change—the stuff was still there, but arranged in different forms. The money that had poured into the manufacture of communications equipment had made that equipment cheap, made the construction of a global internet feasible, and the future growth of internet companies a possibility. He developed a thesis for future success: in the wake of any over-investment there would always be a related opportunity to build upon its ashes in the form of newly cheap supply chains. The money that had been in jds had flowed off towards the next generation of internet companies that its infrastructure had enabled: Google, Amazon and eBay.

<p>Such men brought with them ge values. Taking a cue from Mr Welch, in 2001 Boeing moved its headquarters from Seattle to Chicago, putting distance between the suits in the c-suite and the engineers. As Mr Stonecipher put it in 2004: “When people say I changed the culture of Boeing, that was the intent, so it’s run like a business rather than a great engineering firm.” Shareholders loved it. Over the 15 years since, Richard Abaloufia of the Teal Group, an aviation consultancy, says $78bn was returned to shareholders, doing wonders for Boeing’s share price. But in the process, engineers’ input into decision-making was relegated, which may have contributed to the 737 max’s tragic design flaws. “The seeds of the max disaster were planted years ago,” he wrote recently.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Spinal surgeons, for their part, often take a dim view of evidence that what they do may be ineffective. Surgical training is based on an apprenticeship model. “You learn from a master, a great guru, and you do what they taught you. You don’t learn from a paper in the British Medical Journal,” says Andrew Carr, who heads the department of orthopaedic surgery at Oxford University. Surgeons generally consider an operation successful if the incision is small, things heal nicely and there are no complications, says Maurits van Tulder from Vrije University in Amsterdam. If they ever hear back from patients, that is usually from those for whom the operation worked—which leads surgeons to believe that it works most of the time.</p>

<p>As the sun set over Port-au-Prince on the earthquake’s anniversary, two houngans (Vodou priests) and several mambos (priestesses) gathered in the Bureau National D’Ethnologie for a ceremony for the dead. The mambos chanted and struck spade-shaped fans against clay pots in common time while seated drummers beat polyrhythms with hands and sticks. Instead of producing rhythmic anarchy, the mambos’ measured pulse combined with the drummers’ syncopation to mesmerising effect. That fusion of order and imagination sounded like the sort of beat a more hopeful Haiti could dance to. But its politicians are less skilled than its drummers</p>

<p>Marx predicted that capitalism would destroy every remnant of feudalism. It would tear asunder “the motley feudal ties that bound man to his ‘natural superiors’”, in the words of “The Communist Manifesto”. It would drown ecstasies of religious fervour and chivalric enthusiasm in the “icy water of egotistical calculation”. And it would subject every national institution to the revolutionary logic of the global market.</p>
<p>x .</p>
<p>This type of capitalism is the inverse of feudalism. In a feudal society you are bound to your followers by mutual bonds of obligation. In 21st-century capitalism you accumulate followers in order to monetise them. In a feudal society you are bound to plots of land: Harry is the Duke of Sussex while his elder brother is the Duke of Cambridge. In a 21st-century-capitalist society you are propelled around the world in pursuit of the latest marketing opportunity. It is only fitting that the principal agent of the current debacle, Meghan Markle, is the product of an entertainment business that has done more than any other industry to fulfil Marx’s prediction that “all that is sacred” would be “profaned” and “all that is solid” would “melt into air”.</p>

By combining all of these data the researchers show pretty conclusively that the temperature rose by about 2°C between 400,000 and 200,000 years before the mass extinction. It then fell gradually back over the subsequent 200,000 years to its previous level. They interpret this temperature spike as a consequence of global warming brought about by carbon dioxide released in the Deccan Traps eruptions. This would also have coincided with the rise and decline of other nasties, such as sulphur dioxide, which the Deccan volcanism pumped into the atmosphere. By the time of the mass extinction, in other words, it looks as though things atmospheric had returned to normal. It therefore seems unlikely that the Deccan Traps were responsible for the extinction. Rather, it was the asteroid wot done it.

Many companies, when they set out to hire a new boss, will inevitably come to the same familiar crossroads: a choice between opposites.

Candidate “A” is the reliable, stalwart pick; someone who’ll keep a steady hand on the tiller. Candidate “B” is the unpredictable-maverick option; a creative, impulsive manager who’s liable to turn things upside down: Maverick vs Stalwart

Shakespeare’s Harry combines both. Henry IV parts I and II present is the mischievous but lovable maverick Prince o Wales in the company of Falstaff — a moons man. Then Henry V presents a ruthless cunning and completely transformed young king who abandons his old ways to become a stalwart of his kingdom in expanding its territory to France

<p>“Governments are the only vessels that leak from the top” is a popular government saying referring to the leaking of information.

What goes up must come down and that is a simple consequence of gravity
So one must not wonder why a plane crushes, question why it remains up
Frailty of such a system is out of the question with the brand-new MAX
Doesn’t mean that error by a participating agent in the system was likely
Interactions within a robust system, with chaotic elements—agent inclusive!

<p>Friedrich Nietzsche’s view of virtue is based on the idea of an order of rank among people. For Nietzsche, the virtues of the strong are seen as vices by the weak and slavish, thus Nietzsche’s virtue ethics is based on his distinction between master morality and slave morality. Nietzsche promotes the virtues of those he calls “higher men”, people like Goethe and Beethoven. The virtues he praises in them are their creative powers (“the men of great creativity” - “the really great men according to my understanding” (WP 957)). According to Nietzsche these higher types are solitary, pursue a “unifying project”, revere themselves and are healthy and life-affirming</p>
<p>Because mixing with the herd makes one base, the higher type “strives instinctively for a citadel and a secrecy where he is saved from the crowd, the many, the great majority…” (BGE 26). The ‘Higher type’ also “instinctively seeks heavy responsibilities” (WP 944) in the form of an “organizing idea” for their life, which drives them to artistic and creative work and gives them psychological health and strength.[44] The fact that the higher types are “healthy” for Nietzsche does not refer to physical health as much as a psychological resilience and fortitude. Finally, a Higher type affirms life because he is willing to accept the eternal return of his life and affirm this forever and unconditionally.</p>

So what then did Nietzsche believe politically? In some respects it is difficult to say a priori, since if one could give a strict formula for how to produce the “highest specimens” of humanity then they would cease to be the highest. Instead their greatness and creativity would be manufactured and predictable. As Nietzsche sometimes puts it, a priori formulas must occasionally give way to the nobility of the “nose,” which recognizes the scent of greatness and vulgarity when it is near. My sense is that Nietzsche is best understood as a radical individualist; one who insists passionately that our duty in life is to become what we are. But what kind of person is that? And how can we avoid false paths? I think the deepest clue lies in his profound treatment of resentment, which is well described by Gilles Deleuze in his classic book Nietzsche:

We rediscover the definition of resentment: resentment is a reaction which simultaneously becomes perceptible and ceases to be acted: a formula which defines sickness in general. Nietzsche is not simply saying that resentment is a sickness, but rather that sickness as such is a form or resentment.

<p>For Nietzsche, much of human action which appears superficially great is actually done for slavish reasons. The weakness we feel at our limitations becomes a hatred for those who present themselves as our betters, and we therefore undertake works to either bring them down or prove our own superiority. This can take myriad forms, from the socialist demand to redistribute wealth to the poor to the nationalist demand that intellectually minded cosmopolitans are corrupting the pure soul of the real people. Sometimes it even takes more vulgar forms, for instance when someone engages in self-aggrandizing acts to draw attention to themselves from the mass of people who dared to ignore them. In some circumstances, resentment can lead to tremendous and terrifying outbursts of energy, which give it the appearance of strength and power. But this is a lie, since buried beneath all such acts is a personal and collective weakness which stifles all efforts to truly overcome its opposition.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The person driven by resentment may claim to hate the rich or the foreigner and wish them to be destroyed. But they are also dependent on them, since the only way the resentful can feel any real power is by feeling morally superior to what opposes them. The poor need to feel morally superior to the rich to claim they are victims being exploited, as nationalists needs to feel morally superior to the foreigner to feel pride in their collective identity. In this sense, resentment is an impotent force which can wail and brag, but never achieve anything truly for itself. This is left to the truly great person, who lives for himself and his values and cares little enough for the opinions or actions of others.</p>

<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>Nietzsche and Politics
The goal of humanity lies in its highest specimens.
~Friedrich Nietzsche, Untimely Meditations
Unlike the controversy surrounding Marx and Heidegger, the outrage associated with Nietzsche has given way to ubiquitous and lavish praise. Since the end of the Second World War, thanks in no small part to the tireless efforts of interpreters like Walter Kaufmann, there has been a flurry of more rigorous and charitable interpretations of Nietzsche. The range is truly impressive; perhaps no other philosopher has influenced so many different opinions. Nietzsche was a profound influence on figures like Gilles Deleuze and Michel Foucault who have become prominently associated with the political Left, who supported overcoming society’s remaining moral and traditional barriers to self-creation. Other figures influenced by Nietzsche moved to the political Right, including the libertarian Ayn Rand and the classicist Leo Strauss. Artists have invoked his work to call for radical new aesthetic forms to emerge, while others have appealed to him to decry the decadence of modern art and feeling. Perhaps most interestingly, Nietzsche has even gained some popular traction, with his books selling millions of copies despite their strange topics and myriad styles. Despite this, Nietzsche remains a thinker very much at odds with many of the political positions at play today. This is perhaps inevitable, as Nietzsche was ever the contrarian and would likely have approved of Kierkegaard’s solemn maxim that “when you label me, you negate me.”
Firstly, Nietzsche was certainly in no way a progressive in gestation. He would almost certainly have had nothing but contempt for the postmodern proponents of difference and toleration who invoke aspects of his thought. Nietzsche was a staunch elitist who frequently derided the “herd” which made up most of mankind. And he was openly contemptuous of many cultural practices and traditions; lampooning Buddhism, dismissing the British as a nation of mediocre shopkeepers, and of course endlessly denigrating Judeo-Christianity as religions of “resentment” oriented by a “slave” morality. Moreover, Nietzsche had little good to say about either socialism or radical democracy, regarding them as little more than watered down efforts at secularizing vulgar Christian tropes.

Secondly, Nietzsche would not have been fond of contemporary liberalism—classical or egalitarian—and liberal rights, either. For Nietzsche, the call for rights—whether to private property or welfare—were simply slavish demands by the weak for protection from the worthy and strong. As John Rawls pointed out in his critique of Nietzschian “perfectionism,” there is a strong sense in Nietzsche that society does not exist to benefit all of its members. Instead, it exists to enable the few truly great men and women to rise and establish new and almost god-like kinds of values. It was offensive that such figures must be held back by the mediocrity of humankind; great men like Napoleon cared little for the rights and welfare of others as they rode out to remake the world. This, of course, did not mean that such individuals wanted to trample over others as a sign of their greatness. Rather, as he put in On the Genealogy of Morals, the great “eagle” devotes very little thought one way or another to the “lambs” beneath it. But that includes feelings of pity where the lamb lies between the eagle and its goals.
There is nothing very odd about lambs disliking birds of prey, but this is no reason for holding it against large birds of prey that they carry off lambs. And when the lambs whisper among themselves, ‘These birds of prey are evil, and does this not give us a right to say that whatever of the opposite of a bird of prey must be good?’ there is nothing intrinsically wrong with such an argument—though the birds of prey will look somewhat quizzically and say, ‘We have nothing against these good lambs; in fact, we love them; nothing tastes better than a tender lamb.’

Thirdly, Nietzsche would hardly be a friend of the contemporary Right either, in any of its various forms. Despite some rejigging by figures like Ayn Rand, Nietzsche was hardly a proto-libertarian or classical liberal. Nietzsche disdained consumer culture and capitalism, seeing it as producing vulgar and decadent societies of “last men” focused on the pursuit of meaningless wealth and menial satisfactions. These last men lived out their days in material affluence, but were committed to no truly great projects, mostly concerned with issues like “health” and physical appearance. One can think of the Wall Street icons ridiculed by Bret Easton Ellis in American Psycho, each thinking he was lord of the world and each in fact tedious and indistinguishable from on another. Nietzsche was also dismissive of nationalism, sharing Schopenhauer’s opinion that it was an infantile outlook for individuals not strong enough to will their own destiny without banding together with the rest of the “herd.” Part of this is due to Nietzsche’s personal disdain for German nationalism, and his preference for pan-Europeanism. Whether this means he would be fond of the contemporary European Union, with its liberal outlook and social democratic policies, one can only guess. But he would have certainly regarded the idea of moving away from the nation-state model appealing. 

Finally, Nietzsche would have found the invocations by the far Right—past and present—infuriating. He often looked at his sister Elizabeth’s gradual descent into German nationalism and later Nazism with an uncharacteristic mixture of pity and scorn. Had Nietzsche lived to see the rise of Hitler, he would likely have immediately recognized the Austrian dropout as the mean and resentful creature he was. He would likely have been horrified to see his work on the will to power and the great man transformed into a kind of racist eugenics, insisting that his work was about the individual self and not collective genetic overcoming. And, of course, Nietzsche would regard the deindividuation of totalitarianism, its attempt to completely assimilate the single person into the nation, as nihilistic. Today, no doubt Nietzsche would have lambasted the alt-right efforts to associate his work with concerns about immigration and the racial makeup of society.

So what then did Nietzsche believe politically? In some respects it is difficult to say a priori, since if one could give a strict formula for how to produce the “highest specimens” of humanity then they would cease to be the highest. Instead their greatness and creativity would be manufactured and predictable. As Nietzsche sometimes puts it, a priori formulas must occasionally give way to the nobility of the “nose,” which recognizes the scent of greatness and vulgarity when it is near.

This is left to the truly great person, who lives for himself and his values and cares little enough for the opinions or actions of others.

Conclusion: What Can We Learn From Nietzsche
Nietzsche is one of the most difficult thinkers in the Western canon to think through. This is both in spite and because of his brilliant literary powers. In part due to illness which hampered his ability to write for an extended period of time, most of Nietzsche’s writings appear as aphorisms and short essays rather than sustained works. Nietzsche was also moody and emotional, meaning that he occasionally lashes out with vitriol against a figure or idea which is later treated more soberly. Overall, his philosophy is not a manual for how to become a Nietzschian, but rather how to overcome one’s self limitations and unleash new creative potential and insight. Nonetheless, there are two key points we can pick up from his work.

Firstly, Nietzsche draws our attention to the historical contingency of many of our moral conceits. This is perhaps best accomplished in the On the Genealogy of Morals and the short books Twilight of the Idols and The Antichrist. In these works, Nietzsche develops some of his most striking imagery and ideas. He suggests that most every moral philosopher and figure thus far has failed to recognize that the moral claims they presented were historically and psychologically motivated. They took the moral claims presented as true, when in fact they were culturally or psychologically motivated. The failure to acknowledge this left us unable to recognize the deepest prompts to our actions, leading to a great deal of corruption and vulgarization.

For instance, Nietzsche famously had mixed feelings about Jesus Christ, occasionally ridiculing him, and occasionally praising him as the only opponent worthy of the Antichrist. In either case, he was the only real Christian and he “died on the cross.” Later Christians appropriated his rhetoric to argue that he sought to bring universal love. The reality is that they wanted to replace the aristocratic and warlike ancient Greco-Roman world with one that conformed to the mediocrity of the slaves, and so needed to find a way to re-describe weakness and servility as a moral virtue. The upshot was Christian morality, which was resentful to its core. Nietzsche often gleefully pointed out how the religion of universal love was paranoid about sin, fixating with almost erotic satisfaction on the suffering of those in hell. Nietzsche thought that unawareness of often unconscious motivators leads us to make vulgar and baseless moral claims. This insight is frequently misused today by a host of commentators who substitute pop-psychologism for real analysis of their opponent’s position. Invocations of resentment can also be dangerously overused to dismiss appeals which are really about fairness or justice. Nonetheless, it was a profound contribution to our understanding of morality.
Secondly, and most innovatively, Nietzsche’s writings radically deepened our understanding of what constitutes authentic individuality. Like his existentialist kin Søren Kierkegaard and Simone de Beauvoir, Nietzsche recognized that we all too often regard being an individual as simply doing what we profess to want. It certainly is not mere consumerism and the acquisition of material goods. He draws our attention to the many ways in which external factors like culture and internal psychological motivations like resentment can actually lead us to become false or vulgar iterations of our selves. The task then is to free ourselves from these inauthentic constraints through continuous and arduous self-overcoming.

I don’t think Nietzsche was concerned with ‘authenticity’ in the Maslowian sense (which is where you seem headed in the last paragraph; I don’t know Kierkegaard well enough definitively to add his name here, too.) Don’t forget that Nietzsche believed in the ubiquity of the will to power — he says in ‘The Will To Power’ that the WTP is what we are — and therefore also believed in the inevitability – and value – of great social hierarchies. (And of our fundamental needs to obey — and command.) Any Nietzschean project of ‘becoming who one is’ must therefore reconcile itself with such elemental facts of ‘nature’ and human nature. This is something well beyond ‘self-overcoming’ of (presumably socialized) ‘inauthentic constraints’: it means transcending many constraints we’ve also come to identify as human; becoming (as N says in ‘Beyond Good and Evil’) at once ‘more G-d and more beast’.Also, you make no mention of N’s epistemology — which is a useful part of his moral critique and not at all separate from it. Because we misperceive the world – via anthropological and linguistic errors – we also fail to see its essence — the sovereignty of the will to power. (We mistakenly believe in ‘things’, cause and effect, etc. – the whole mechanistic universe.) This erroneous ‘dependable and logical’ world we’ve constructed for ourselves is also not ‘noble’ in N’s view: ‘reason,’ science and the deification of Truth are for him already moralistic corruptions of the spirit; and they have accordingly only added to the original perceptual/phenomenological errors of our forefathers. (Quantum physics, or at least so I glean, also seems to be leaning to a conception of the world not composed of matter but of loci of information; or perhaps as N would say, of ‘centers of force’.) For Nietzsche, any ‘optimum individual’ (we used to call him the Superman) must needs grasp all this, too, and see the world in a wholly new way: as composed of the will to power and nothing more.Though perhaps no one can yet experience such a world-view, Nietzsche’s argument does draw back the veil and raise our consciousness almost to the point.

The corresponding strategy for economics is obvious: to secure new kinds of data at the micro level, data that will provide direct evidence about the behavior of economic agents and the ways in which they go about making their decisions (support fo this thesis comes from surprising directions. See Lucas, 1980, pp.288-289).

After completing her doctoral studies, Otele was made an Associate Professor at Université Paris XIII. She has written about cultural and collective memory and the memorialisation of the past. She analyses the legacies of European colonisation in post-slavery societies. She has also published academic articles about Afro-European identities, including &#39;Frenchness&#39;, British identities in Wales, and what it meant to be British, Welsh and Black

In 2018, at the age of 48, Otele became the first Black woman to be made Professor of History in the United Kingdom.[6] She acknowledged that her promotion to the professoriate took longer because she has caring responsibilities as a mother to two children and because she is a woman of colour.[14] The Race, Ethnicity &amp; Equality Report published by the Royal Historical Society in October 2018 found that only 0.5% of historians working in UK universities are black.[15] Until Otele&#39;s promotion there had never been a black woman Professor of History in the UK.[16] Otele hopes that her appointment will &#39;open the door for many hard-working women, especially black women in academia&#39;.[17] On her promotion Otele commented that &quot;any success that is used only to improve one&#39;s own life is a waste of possibilities. That is why being the first black female history professor does not mean anything to me if I&#39;m not given and can&#39;t find means to bring others up.&quot;[5] Otele also highlighted the difficulties she encountered in becoming a Professor: &quot;I&#39;ve worked very hard and kept pushing and had a family...It&#39;s hard. I&#39;m tired. It&#39;s bleak.&quot;[18] The Vice-Chancellor of Bath Spa University, Professor Susan Rigby described Otele as &quot;world-class and internationally respected&quot;.[19] Otele announced her promotion from her active Twitter account.[20]

Many literary critics have written interpretations of Shakespeare from a Marxist perspective, and several prominent commentators on Shakespeare (like George Bernard Shaw and Bertolt Brecht) drew on Marxian ideas in their understanding of his body of work. The Russian revolutionary Leon Trotsky, unusually steeped in European literary culture for a Bolshevik, sought to explain what was so interesting about Shakespeare to Marxists:

In the tragedies of Shakespeare, which would be entirely unthinkable without the Reformation*, the fate of the ancients and the passions of the mediaeval Christians are crowded out by individual human passions, such as love, jealousy, revengeful greediness, and spiritual dissension. But in every one of Shakespeare’s dramas, the individual passion is carried to such a high degree of tension that it outgrows the individual, becomes super-personal, and is transformed into a fate of a certain kind. The jealousy of Othello, the ambition of Macbeth, the greed of Shylock, the love of Romeo and Juliet, the arrogance of Coriolanus, the spiritual wavering of Hamlet, are all of this kind…

For Trotsky, Shakespeare represents the birth of modern literature by placing the individual man, his own personal desires and emotions, in the centre of the narrative, symbolizing the equally progressive and destructive aspirations for personal emancipation characterizing the bourgeois revolt against feudalism. After Shakespeare, he writes, ‘we shall no longer accept a tragedy in which God gives orders and man submits. Moreover, there will be no one to write such a tragedy.’

<p>I recall too with great intensity an early reading experience that had nothing to do with imaginative literature. I read Nietzsche’s “Genealogy of Morals” — I do not know where I would have come across it — and I was unbelievably disturbed by it. I can only think of the French word, bouleversé, turned upside down. … it still seems to me an astonishing work, marvelous and hateful at the same time, brilliant and horrible. Even now, so many years later, I can actually channel the feeling, as it were, of getting hit by its intellectual and rhetorical violence.  Greeblatt</p>

Peter Lee of Euromoney blows it out of the park here —FYI he joined Euromoney straight from Oxford university in 1985, swapping the delights of studying Coleridge and Wordsworth for the more rigorous discipline of breaking news out of the syndicated loan market.

Taking over from a legendary figure at the firm at a troubled moment in its history, Thiam studied the earnings profile, growth potential, embedded risks and running costs of each of the bank’s core businesses, as well as the group capital position and reporting structure.

<p>With neat spectacles, sharply parted hair and a taste for discreet but heavyweight timepieces by the luxury Swiss With neat spectacles, sharply parted hair and a taste for discreet but heavyweight timepieces by the luxury Swiss watchmaker IWC, Mr Khan always cut a smooth figure at gatherings in Zurich. But it was his solicitous interest in others, and memory for small personal details, that marked him out on the social circuit from other hard-driving titans of high finance. Mr Khan always cut a smooth figure at gatherings in Zurich</p>

<p>His resignation capped a four-month corporate surveillance saga that has haunted Credit Suisse and cast a shadow over the entire Swiss banking sector. The fallout has also reignited allegations of xenophobia and racism that have hung over Zurich’s insular elite since Mr Thiam — the first black chief executive of a major European bank — was appointed from insurer Prudential five years ago.</p>

I don’t want to underestimate the complexity of banking, but I’m hardly a stranger to financial services or to financial markets,” Thiam tells Euromoney. “We all deal with the same yield curve, the same equity markets, the same volatility. Yet people were acting as if I had landed at the bank from planet Mars. Saying that it was risky for Credit Suisse to appoint a non-banker felt to me like a cheap shot.”

<p>Goldman was traditionally solid and staid, slow to move into new businesses or to expand outside the US. Commodities trader J Aron, bought in 1981, was Goldman’s first acquisition since 1923. The firm waited until 1988 before following the rest of Wall Street into asset management and until 1990 before running a swaps book of any size. It did not squander its capital on high-risk bridge loans to LBOs. It also resisted buying a UK broker. Instead, Goldman used its reputation as an expert defender in contested acquisitions.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>A UK merchant banker recalls a meeting about a European privatization deal held on a stormy weekend in the city of London, late last year. Realizing that nothing more could be done that evening, bankers from various firms started hailing taxis and heading their separate ways. The Goldman team, to the amazement of their British counterparts, suddenly appeared in tracksuits and set off running together through the sleet and rain towards west London.</p>

<p>Lorenz: There are several. Indoctrination by ideology is one of the cultural factors capable of causing the most serious derailments of collective aggression. A doctrine’s power of conviction increases with the square of the number of men participating in it—the relationship is geometric. As soon as a doctrine has a sufficient number of adherents, the nonconformist becomes a heretic who must be liquidated.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of people in the world; those who try to fit our chaotic existence into a semblance of order, and those who believe that the best one can do is surf the waves of chaos as reality hurls them at you. The latter group has much to thank Nassim Nicholas Taleb for. Taleb’s famous book, The Black Swan, describes the power of unforeseeable events, and the damage they can wreak on unsuspecting societies. This Lebanese-American writer and statistician thinks of himself as an epistemologist of randomness as opposed to a businessman. His work on probability examines the limitations of knowledge, and likewise proves the importance of anticipating seemingly impossible scenarios.</p>
<p>This extremely skeptical starting point has led Taleb to oppose large scale social theorizing. He has gone so far as to say that the Nobel Prize in economics should be done away with, for the damage that economic metanarratives does is immense. Instead, he advances what he calls “robustification” and “anti-fragility.” Not surprisingly, his Ph.D. dissertation focused on the mathematics of derivatives pricing, which is arguably the most unstable part of the market. Regardless of whether you think Taleb goes too far in his sweeping rebuttal of most economic theorizing, at the very least this very bright man’s words are a much needed call for sobriety in a market otherwise known for excess.</p>

<p>During the time they were together, Nietzsche wrote a remarkable passage on women and sex, uniquely insightful for a man of the time. It was, he wrote, a monstrous paradox that women were brought up in the deepest ignorance about sex. They were told it was evil and shameful. And then, on the wedding night, the man they had been taught to worship as a god subjected them to the religious duty and animal terror of it. ‘This has tied a psychic knot that has no equal’, Nietzsche concluded, anticipating Freud.</p>

By Peter Bearse

Introduction: Fractal Patterns
It&#39;s too bad. With the popularity of fractal calendars and popular writers who know nothing of mathematics and little of science playing on &quot;chaos&quot;, the new concept has become a cliche&#39;. It&#39;s too bad, because even those who understand chaos and the mathematics underlying fractal art have missed the revolutionary implications of the new concept for understanding and improving human society.

Human life is inherently chaotic. People have felt it to be so since the beginning of recorded time. They have sometimes sensed, but mostly prayed, that the chaos may have an underlying structure. Only recently, however, has this hope been expressed in scientific/mathematical terms, as the tracings of an underlying reality rather than merely the subject of deep human yearning. Until the French Revolution, the structure of human existence was an article of transcendental faith rather than human knowledge. The basic &quot;structure&quot; was millennial -- the apocryphal City of God, reified by vain men in the form of monuments and causes.

The discovery that the &quot;geometry of nature&quot; is fractal has radical implications for human beings&#39; understanding of their society and of their role in things social and political. What does this mean? It means that there is now, for the first time in human history, a firm mathematical and scientific basis for a continuing (r)evolution of society worldwide in ways that focus upon the fulfillment of individual potential as the fundamental aim of human development. Individuals and their actions, however small and localized they may be, can finally be recognized as influences on historical patterns. The &quot;big picture&quot; is a construct of many tiny, interactive patterns. The &quot;Organization Man&quot; is dead or dying in any of his &quot;top down&quot; variations.

Some would say that such a basis was provided over two hundred years ago by the Enlightenment based upon Newtonian physics. Yet, even at the time, the great English artist and poet, William Blake, recognized that this was not so. Subsequent history up to the present time was to prove him right. The Enlightenment was grounded in scientific values, especially relentless testing of theories in light of experimental facts. Mathematical theories provided the basis of Newtonian physics, however, were also employed to rationalize hierarchical systems of power -- the dominance of the &quot;little&quot; by the &quot;big,&quot; of the &quot;lower&quot; by the &quot;higher,&quot; etc. Now, such inversions can revert to turn the right side up. The true math-ematical-scientific basis for a continuing American revolution has only recently come into view. And such a view it is! -- the potential empowerment of the individual in all spheres depicted by color graphics, creative advertising and fascinating geometrical figures as well as mathematical formulae and scientific studies; enabled by &quot;decentralization,&quot; &quot;devolution,&quot; &quot;flattening of hierarchies,&quot; &quot;reinvention&quot; of selves and organizations, &quot;learning organizations,&quot; &quot;grass roots&quot; individual or community-based initiatives; &quot;think globally; act locally,&quot; and many other ways.

The basis of the fractal revolution is the principle underlying chaos and other natural patterns, that of &quot;self-similarity.&quot; This means that the basic patterns are the same at any scale. They are the same at large &quot;macro&quot; scales as at small &quot;micro&quot; scales. The large is revealed by, and grows out from, the small. Wholes mimic parts (and vice versa); the bigger is revealed in the smaller.

We can see this, for example, in the branching patterns of plants, trees, rivers organizations or even the lines in an old man&#39;s face. In your kitchen, repeat a simple demonstration.employed by Benoit Mandelbrot, the &quot;father of fractals.&quot;(2) Pick up a cauliflower. Look at it, then pick it apart. Note how the pieces, however small, replicate the structure of the whole. That is self-similarity. Look at the veins of the leaf of a tree in summer and then at the bare dendritic structure of its branches in winter. The patterns are self-similar. Notice, from an airplane, the branching patterns of a great river. Then, close to the ground, notice the intricate, tiny pattern made by rain flowing from a puddle. The patterns are self-similar. See below.

Next, examine the organization charts of organizations and their branch units. The patterns are sometimes self-similar. To the extent that the latter are not so, they are likely to become more so as organizations, following the advice of advanced management &quot;gurus&quot; like Peters (1987) and Handy (1994), introduce concepts borrowed from chaos and evolutionary biology into organizational designs. Germany&#39;s Fraunhofer Institute, for example, an advanced industrial R&amp;D organization, advertises the fact that its structure is &quot;fractal.&quot; So does Renault, the giant French auto company. Renault uses a Serpinski diagram, a famous fractal figure, to illustrate the essentials of its &quot;total quality management&quot; structure, as shown below. Both software developers and entrepreneurs growing technology-based enterprises think and talk in terms of the &quot;scalability&quot; of designs and companies.

Thus, the mathematics and science of fractals have finally revealed what some philosophers have only hoped or surmised over the past two millennia; namely that:

* the &quot;microcosm,&quot; that which is smaller or lower-level, is essentially similar to the &quot;macrocosm,&quot; that which is larger and/or higher-level; the latter is not somehow superior to the former by virtue of size or level; and... 
* the dynamics of development are such that the macrocosm springs from and is grounded in the microcosm, not the other way around. 
* 
The implications of these insights are so revolutionary that some of those who have been so foolish or courageous to speak or write them in the past have been burned at the stake. We like to think of ourselves as being more civilized or &quot;modern,&quot; but the brutal, inhuman, bloody history of the century now ending but still continuing belies any such naivete.

A fractal figure is a snapshot of a dynamic system at a stage of development. The snapshot is a clue to a dynamic process - a pattern of development. One basic pattern is that of a flowing stream. In response to a force (gravity), the water&#39;s potential energy becomes actual. The stream will branch in various ways as it runs into various barriers and constraints. As the stream speed increases, the flow pattern may become chaotic, as with rapids for example.

Another pattern is that of a growing tree. In response to another source of energy, the sun, a tree grows and branches in various ways depending on a variety of resources, opportunities, barriers and constraints. Compare the growth patterns of a fan palm in a tropical garden with that of a scrub pine in a northern rocky crag. The fractal patterns are basically similar but also quite different, one graceful; the other, gnarled.
Fractal patterns are all around us, exhibited by human social organization, works of art, music and poetry as well as by nature. There are computer graphics and the fact that fractal mathematics provides compression algorithms through which complex graphical patterns can be stored. There is poetry with fractal metaphors; e.g. 

* William Blake, whose poetry and graphic art linked &quot;microcosm&quot; and &quot;macrocosm&quot; as, for example, in his famous line &quot;A dog starved at his Master&#39;s gate predicts the ruin of the state&quot; (in Auguries of Innocence). 
* Charles Olson, whose MAXIMUS poems reflect &quot;The Human Universe&quot; in a microcosm called Gloucester, Massachusetts. 
* William Carlos Williams, whose PATTERSON poems project that small (New Jersey) city in analogous ways; 
* Amy Clampitt, whose WHAT THE LIGHT WAS LIKE finds larger meanings in small, localized, seemingly idiosyncratic vignettes. 
* Also, from history, we have Zeldin&#39;s INTIMATE HISTORY OF HUMANITY, which interrelates the &quot;microcosm&quot; (histories of particular individuals) with the &quot;macrocosm&quot; (human concerns of cultures over centuries) through a set of fascinating essays. We also have &quot;minimalist&quot; music, in which slight differences in initial rhythmic or tone patterns are magnified as the work progresses, as in some pieces by Steve Reich, for example. 
* 
Researchers have detected fractal patterns in widely disparate areas of scientific observation and practical concern. The most recent examples are only a small subset of a great many that could be cited as showing the broad and varied applicability of fractal concepts; e.g. --

* the structure of the universe [Martinez (1999)], 
* features of wireless communications, including the structure of antennae and of the World-Wide Web/Internet(work) [Musser, (1999); CAIDA (1998)], 
* changes in stock market prices [Mandlebrot, 1999], 
* the metabolic structure of the human body [West, Brown and Enquist (1999)], and 
* how to solve the problem of &quot;delivering cement in Mexico&quot; [Katel (1997)]. 
* 
Thus, it seems that no matter where one looks, fractal patterns can be seen now that we have been enabled to see them. What Blaise Pascal, French mathematician and philosopher, observed over three centuries ago can now be truly noted:

&quot;Nature imitates herself. A grain thrown onto good ground brings forth fruit; a principle thrown into a good mind brings forth fruit. Everything is created and conducted by the same Master - the root, the branch, the fruits, the principles, the consequences.&quot;

Dynamic Systems
Fractal patterns are not simply revealed by geometries of things as they are or have become; they are also revealed by processes of change from one state of development to another. Self-similar fractal patterns characterize diagrams depicting the dynamics of change; e.g., phase diagrams of rates of change in weather patterns, heartbeats and water flows. The discovery of such a pattern behind the behavior of a model of weather changes by Edward Lorenz, for example, led to his coining the now famous descriptor &quot;butterfly effect.&quot; The model&#39;s behavior indicated (hypothetically) that the flap of a butterfly&#39;s wings in Brazil could lead to a tornado in Texas. The validity of such inferences has since been confirmed many times over in systems of all types. The implication? -- that small moves by micro-actors can lead to big (&quot;macro&quot;) changes.

A key feature linking fractals and chaos in the dynamics of change is &quot;starting positions.&quot; Even miniscule differences in these lead to increasing divergence over time. The results are unpredictable; that is, one cannot say that, if the starting positions are &#39;x&#39; and &#39;y&#39;, then the ending positions will be &#39;x+m&#39; and &#39;y+n&#39; with any acceptable degree of confidence -- even if we understand precisely how the &#39;xy&#39; &quot;system&quot; behaves.

How is the &quot;fractal revolution&quot; in the understanding of dynamic systems relevant to human lives? -- in more ways than a brief article can recount. Consider, for example, the current debate over &quot;inequality.&quot; In an increasingly open and competitive market economy which, since the mid &#39;70&#39;s, has been increasingly dependent upon the initiatives of &quot;micro-actors&quot; (entrepreneurs), it should be no surprise to see increasing inequality of income and wealth. This would happen even if each of us entered the economic race with equal endowments (of wealth, intelligence, education, et. al.) but, of course, we don&#39;t. Each of our &quot;starting positions&quot; is different. Any attempts to improve the life chances of those whose starting positions are, in some sense, &quot;disadvantaged&quot; are doomed to be counterproductive if the nature of the dynamics of our &quot;new economy&quot; is not understood.

The manifold human implications of fractal patterns, however they may be revealed, will take some time to be worked out in detail; yet, even now we can begin to see some of their potentials of the fractal perspective in several spheres of human concern. After all, even in this so-called &quot;&#39;modern&quot; or &quot;postmodern&quot; age, major features of human society still rest on the following pre-modern; indeed, ancient assumptions (3) -- that:

* macrocosm and microcosm are, in some sense, essentially very different from, and independent of, each other; 
* the macrocosm exists at a level which is somehow higher than, superior to or more authoritative than the microcosm; and... 
* initiatives of micro-actors count for little in &quot;the scheme of things&quot; or towards bringing about historical changes; rather, they react to those arising from higher level, &quot;bigger&quot; or more powerful (&quot;macro&quot;) actors and agencies. Most &quot;ordinary&quot; people still feel they don&#39;t count. 
* 
Fractal structures and dynamics contradict these assumptions. That is why the adjective &quot;revolution&quot; is used in the title of this article.

Preliminary, Suggestive Observations Reflecting Some Applications and Implications of Fractal Perspectives
Consider the following dichotomies, in which &quot;--&quot; denotes the type of relationship commonly assumed; that is, a super-ordinate -- sub-ordinate (&quot;superior to&quot;) relationship between the two sides of each divide:

* Man - Nature 
* National government -- local government 
* God - Man 
* Politics - Life 
* Society -- Family 
* Adults -Children 
* 
We can begin to see whether there is anything revolutionary in the fractal perspective through preliminary, trial applications to see whether its features offer any new insights into traditional patterns and interrelations. First, recognize essential self-similarities between the levels marked by each of the above divides. Then acknowledge their implications.

The major implication is the need to shift responsibility between the levels and to reduce barriers and constraints that the (presumptively) &quot;higher&quot; levels place on the development of the (presumptively) &quot;lower.&quot; Where this is not acknowledged and overcome, we see misalignment of responsibilities and dominance/sub- dominance relationships that limit and distort development at &quot;lower&quot; levels by presumably less significant, less powerful or smaller entities. The (--) divide in each of the above dichotomies signifies such potential problems.
What are the more specific &quot;revolutionary&quot; implications of the fractal structure of features that are human as well as natural? They are often paradoxical. Consider each of the several major divides in turn.

Man - Nature
Since the environmental movement has spread worldwide, it may seem surprisingly backward to posit a divide between &quot;Man&quot; and &quot;Nature.&quot; Yet, we still lack a solid foundation for an ethic of ecology. The lack of such underlies many conflicts; for example, those which surfaced at the Global Warming Conference in Kyoto. We still need to reaffirm man in nature and nature in man and resolve the paradox of Man as animal and not-animal.
The fractal branching pattern of development in both Man and Nature provides at least part of a foundation. Any adult reflecting on his past history has come to appreciate, with Robert Frost, the meaning of &quot;The Path Not Taken.&quot; Similarly, we can look back on how paths taken have traced patterns as &quot;one thing led to another&quot; through odd combinations of chance and design. If we fail to see this dynamic pattern in human life, starting with the development of the fetus and, over far greater spans of time, through the course of evolution, then we will continue to believe the destructive myth of Man -- Nature -- Man apart from or over Nature, as if the whole of creation lies at our behest. As a result of this arrogant, unnatural presumption, we can now see the contraction rather than the radiation of species. If reason rather than presumption were to govern, the inversion would be more justified, Nature -- Man, The truth revealed by the fractal structure of nature reinforces that from evolution, that nature is in man and man in nature.

The synthesis of science and art revealed by computer art generated through self-similar fractal geometry provides one of the finest representations of the convergence of Man and Nature. For centuries, the gap between art and science supplied the aesthetic symbols and intellectual substance of the presumed divide between Man and Nature.

No one can reasonably question that the environmental movement has been a revolutionary force in our time. The force, however, is far from spent. It can be renewed by insights derived from the fractal structures of Man and Nature interacting, each the ecological framework for the other.

National Government -- Local Government
The divide here is deceptive since the two levels appear to be quite self-similar in a decentralized democratic system. The national President and Congress, state governors and legislatures, and local Mayors and Councils are self-similar structures of government at each level. An older, more basic and democratic unit of government, however, is the Town Meeting, a form that is receiving increasing attention as a means to reduce the growing, nationwide alienation of people&#39;s lives from politics.

National government is not a community, family or village, nor can it be made so. To the extent national government has any essential meaning except as an instrument of national security, it is as a servant of community, family or village -- the basic, &quot;micro&quot; units of democracy. National issues are local and non-local. Local concerns are national and not national. The paradox is resolved if we view national government, not as a body with a life of its own, but as a federation of city-villages. This view has been set forth by Charles Handy in 

The Age of Paradox.
That this view has any but revolutionary implications for the structure of government and the nature of our political life would be hard to deny. Among other things, it implies a revised national Constitution and significant diminution of the powers, plus revisions of the roles of, higher levels of government. Some of this has already been seen to a limited extent via the kinds of decentralization sometimes referred to as &quot;devolution&quot; -- efforts to shift power and money from the national government to the states in the United States.

God - Man
God is dead and alive; alive if alive in us, if not, dead. Like many features of human life, if God did not exist we would have to invent Him (or Her). We have invented Him. Whoever or whatever our God may be, that God is the construct of our highest hopes, yearnings, creativity, values and imagination. As the famous evolutionary biologist, Gaylord Simpson, wrote, &quot;Man Makes Himself.&quot; This includes the God(s) we worship unless, unlike most religions, &quot;God&quot; is equated to &quot;Universe.&quot; If the universe is, as physicist Freeman Dyson indicates, &quot;Infinite in all Directions,&quot; then man and man&#39;s world can once again be seen at the center.
The alternative, conventional view, that God exists apart from Man, somehow higher, apart from and independent of humanity, has been the source of incredible inhumanity, brutality and grief throughout recorded history. The end of such history is not yet in sight. This non-self-similar view has allowed Man to project himself on God and to project God upon states, wars and alliances. Thus, Kings and other rulers, their rationales for oppression and their wars are made holy, through unholy alliances between rulers and organized religion. As Ernest Becker (1975) has shown (and as William Blake realized 200 years ago), such projections are the essence of evil.

Adults -Children
The quality of our lives and, indeed, the humanity of our communities, would be greatly improved if the essential self-similarity between adults and children were recognized. Sayings attest to this over hundreds of years, such as &quot;the child in the man&quot; and &quot;childhood is lost on children.&quot; Adults are children and not-children. Children strive to imitate and become adults. The great English artist and poet William Blake resolved the paradox about 200 years ago in his Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience.

Conscious realization and application of the concept of self-similarity would help us to make significant, desirable changes and to understand some that are already underway. One such change, for example, is the growing acceptance of &quot;lifelong learning&quot; as a goal, rather than seeing &quot;learning&quot; as something limited to what young people do in schools.

Other artificial, limiting and counterproductive divides and distinctions between childhood and adulthood could also be overcome. For at least 200 years and even now, schools have served to drive the best qualities of children out of them, thinking that such purgation is required for children to become adults. These qualities include creativity, playfulness, openness, critical thinking, questioning and challenging behavior. Fortunately, the new economy values the entrepreneur more than &quot;The Organization Man&quot;, so some of the creative qualities of children are now valued in adults.

Self-similarly, on the side of childhood, our growing up would be helped greatly through recognition that much of the adulthood&gt;&gt;childhood divide in American society undermines both childhood and adulthood. We take pride in extending our children&#39;s feckless, irresponsible childhoods rather than insisting that they take on responsibilities in the household and community that give them tests and tastes of adult life. It is no surprise that American society contains so many childish adults.

Would the changes implied here be &quot;revolutionary&quot;? -- not in the sense of 1789 or 1917 but in the more basic sense of real, desirable change -- towards a more open, creative, democratic and adaptable society. Such changes would be all the better for working their way through our lives gradually rather than suddenly or violently. It is not inconceivable even to imagine a new, 21st Century Renaissance based on the best qualities of adults who are more like children and children who are more like adults -- the American character triumphant.

Politics -- Life
Politics and government in even the most self consciously democratic societies have evolved to the point where they are specialized, separate -- activities which appear to influence our lives without being part of them. In many countries, including the United States, this has gotten to the point of &quot;us&quot; vs. &quot;them.&quot; &quot;Them&quot; is the small minority of people, including career politicians and political &quot;spinmeisters,&quot; consultants, pundits and junkies whose lives are consumed by politics while, for the great majority, politics are not a part of their lives at all.
An important part of an answer to the growing political alienation featured above is the realization that politics and life are self-similar. Politics is like life; life is like politics. Politics is not &quot;out here&quot; or &quot;up there.&quot; Life without politics is not complete; politics disconnected from the rest of life is tyranny.

The self-similarity is most apparent to those who run for office or manage a political campaign. Then, politics is like life only more so -- life when the tape is run at four times normal speed, life at its most intense. Decisions are made, large and small. The path(s) branch and divide. Paths not taken become the source of later speculations of the &quot;what went wrong&quot; variety. The inner circle, the confidants of a candidate, become like family. One learns who one&#39;s friends truly are. There are disappointments and betrayals. There are triumphs and victories. Most of all, there is the growing realization of adult life -- that most of what one does has consequences that affect others and that the politics of our most intimate, &quot;private&quot; interactions in family, business and other settings, are essentially similar to those in larger, &quot;public&quot; world(s).

Society - Family
A family is a society in miniature. Many concepts of community or society are predicated on a model of the nuclear family. But society is more than just an aggregation of families. It is, as is every higher level entity -- a projection and a construct of meaning by more integral and behaviorally basic entities, the fundamental &quot;micro&quot; units of being, becoming and concern -- families and individuals. The latter &quot;invest&quot; in their higher level constructs in many ways, especially to invest them with meaning(s). Such investment is most meaningful to the extent that the higher level structures are self-similar to the lower level -- in being:

* Open systems 
* Innovative or diversifying 
* Integral, organic systems of some integrity 
* Learning systems 
* Able to represent values that families hold dear 
* 
A closed system may be impervious to input. A society which is not open to innovation or diversification lacks even the tolerance for diversity which family members need to deal with differences among themselves. Both a family and a society have some integrity to the extent they honor traditions based on their own history (ies). Both a family and a society need to have ways of learning to adapt to changing circumstances. And if there is not a set of shared values; indeed, values-in-practice that the society is able to represent, then none of the above may count for much.

Are these similarities &quot;revolutionary&quot;? -- only to the extent that they are missing, and, unfortunately, there is much that seems to be missing. At this point, without searching the literature for studies that might shed some light, one can only speculate. One could claim that &quot;society&quot; has it has been known in the past no longer exists. At least, &quot;society&quot; as it is now viewed by most through the media differs substantially from that of the past and appears to differ substantially from &quot;family&quot; as it is known to the majority of families. Perhaps this has been one factor leading to the establishment of mini-societies -- small social worlds of relatives, friends, affections or belief for which people have affinity and affection. The larger society, especially as depicted by the media, may be seen as foreign, unethical or distasteful. The implications of tendencies to devolve to small worlds as an antithesis or escape from the perceived shortcomings of the large are quite serious but, for now, they are left for others to imagine.

Conclusion
In the past, major scientific discoveries, theories or revolutions have led to paradigm shifts in the social sciences. The latter have been known for having inferiority complexes relative to the physical and mathematical sciences. Thus, too often, social scientists have almost slavishly imitated, adapted or applied physical and mathematical science frameworks to social worlds. We must be wary of this danger as we recognize how fractal geometries enable us to see many things in new ways and extend interpretations of these into the human domain.
There is one aspect of the above &quot;danger&quot; that is readily avoidable within the new fractal paradigm even though it was not avoided within earlier scientific/ mathematical frames. This is the careless use of the latest scientific theory to justify undemocratic and inhumane forms of social organization or government policies. Toulmin (1994) documents what has also been noted by many others -- the use of Newtonian science to rationalize and uphold hierarchical systems of domination and governance over the past 300 years. These implications of Newtonian science were reinforced by the use of Darwin&#39;s theory of natural selection to justify &quot;Social Darwinism.&quot; These developments were possible because Newtonian science provided strictly quantitative, closed, hierarchical and predictable models of the cosmos.

By contrast, the new fractal paradigm presented here, supported by other major 20th century developments in physics and biology, provides a qualitative, open, non-hierarchical, unpredictable set of patterns which support decentralized, humane and democratic lines of human development. What we see is not a closed set of equations that suggest that human development &quot;will&quot; or &quot;should&quot; follow a predetermined or predicted trajectory dictated from &quot;above,&quot; but an open, variegated set of patterns that suggests possibilities for their realization via human choices at the most basic, individual level.

For what is truly revolutionary in the preceding is that the presumably &quot;micro&quot; or &quot;lower level&quot; units have become the most important points of reference. The lack of self-similarity of the &quot;higher&quot; level units becomes, then, a normative prescription -- they should be self-similar to the structure and developmental behavior of the lower level units in certain essential ways.

It is such involution -- overturning presumed authorities and their assumptions -- that is tantamount to a revolution, just as it seemed to be in the late 18th century with the eruption of the American and French Revolutions. Since then, beginning with the Civil War, we have raised up a national government as if it had some larger meaning and higher level authority above that of the constituent micro- units that make up American society, whereas the self-similar truth is the other way around. &quot;America&quot;, unlike most other countries, has authority, meaning and integrity only to the extent that its government recognizes that authority, meaning and integrity reside in its constituent micro-units, individuals most of all but also families and local governments.
Even now, in all sorts of ways, we attach authority and meanings to higher level entities. Many such attributions or imputations are unjustified. Many are justified only to the extent that their structure and behavior are self-similar to that of the micro-units they supposedly &quot;govern&quot; -- so that they support micro-units and nurture rather than constrain their development potentials.

It may seem odd to hold out as &quot;revolutionary&quot; a vision that is over two hundred years old, yet we need to return to our revolutionary roots in order to construct a vision that is up to the challenge of a new century in a time of rapid change. We also need to recognize that the &quot;Enlightenment&quot; that informed the revolutions of two hundred years ago was deficient even then. (4) It was based upon the science and mathematics; that is, the &quot;natural philosophy&quot; of its time. Even then, one man recognized the deficiency, the English poet, William Blake. The fractal concept of self-similarity based upon the science and mathematics of our own time is consistent with a Blakean vision expressed in terms of myth and allegory, partly because of the bridge between art and science that has been built of fractal geometries.

As indicated by the discussion of &quot;divides,&quot; a new/old vision starts with a recognition that it is the micro-behavioral units that are fundamental -- most of all, individuals, but also including other &quot;micro&quot; units such as families, small businesses and small sub-units of larger organizations. This is also the basic assumption underlying early 21st century management practices. It is the realization that, if you want to change things for the better, you have to be able to change behaviors of independent, self-organizing behavioral units. If you can&#39;t do that, then no desirable changes are likely to emerge. After all the bloody, inhuman, so-called &quot;revolutions&quot; of this century and the two preceding, this is a peaceful approach to change. We may be doing something wrong, dangerous or inhumane to the extent that we project higher level attributes or meanings on aggregations of people that have not arisen through organic, self-organizing, constitutionally liberal, democratic and competitive processes of development. (5)

Does the fractal concept provide the basis for &quot;empowering&quot; the disempowered? Yes, but in a way that goes beyond the usual &quot;from the top down&quot; passage of &quot;empowerment,&quot; as Charles Handy in his Age of Paradox has already suggested. The words of the Magi in the movie animation Fern Gully: The Last Rainforest are apropos of an empowering fractal vision: &quot;There are worlds within worlds. Everything is connected by the delicate strands of life. Anybody can call upon the cosmic forces of life. You have to find the power within yourself.&quot;

Eventually, this vision may provide a valid intellectual basis for integration of the themes of the French Revolution and the realization of Blake&#39;s dream -- that all three, &quot;liberty, equality, fraternity,&quot; might be fulfilled, together. This possibility may yet ignite the hopes and engage the energies of a new generation. Back to the future?

2 As referred to by Manfred Schroeder (1991) (and many others in similar terms). The phrase &quot;geometry of nature&quot; is Mandlebrot&#39;s, from the title of the second edition of his seminal book (Mandlebrot, 1977).

3 Bruno Latour, in his book WHY WE ARE NOT MODERN, challenges the &quot;modern&quot;/&quot;pre- modern&quot; distinction and shows just how artificial it is in many ways.

4 This point and its larger implications have been elaborated by Stephen Toulmin in his book COSMOPOLIS (Toulmin, 1994).

5 The distinction between a &quot;constitutionally liberal&quot; democracy, arising from &quot;the American system,&quot; and &quot;plebiscitary democracy,&quot; arising from the &quot;the French (Revolution) model,&quot; is an important one which has been well made recently by Zakaria (1997). The former is based upon &quot;an avowedly pessimistic conception of human nature;&quot; the latter, upon &quot;faith in the goodness of human beings.&quot; The distinction was made earlier by Lipow (1996), who shows how the American model, especially if shed of its &quot;Progressive&quot; era overlays, is the basis for a truly democratic system while the French model is fundamentally undemocratic.

(1882 - 1971)

Copeland’s father was a businessman who disapproved of his son becoming a musician, but his mother, who was Spanish, encouraged her child, and young George began piano lessons at the age of five with Karl Baermann who had studied with Liszt. Frequent trips to Europe with his mother enabled George to study with Teresa Carreño in Berlin, and he later had lessons with Harold Bauer; but it remains uncertain what formed Copeland’s unusually clear piano tone, or his penchant for the music of Debussy.

Copeland played recitals and chamber music in Boston from the late 1890s, and his performances of Debussy in 1905 and 1906 were notable events. The famous Boston critic Philip Hale (1854–1934) wrote that Copeland’s best attributes were ‘…his touch of crystalline clearness; his exquisite sense of rhythm; his intimate variety of tonal colors’. Hale championed French music, and in Copeland must have found an ideal performer.

After playing in Vienna, Rome and Milan in 1911, Copeland travelled to Paris to meet Debussy. After hearing ten of his pieces played for him, Debussy responded, ‘It is not my habit to pay compliments. But I wish to say, Mr Copeland, that I never thought to hear my music played as well as that in my lifetime.’

Between 1915 and 1921 Copeland worked with Isadora Duncan and her dancers who danced to his renditions of Chopin. During the 1920s it appears that Copeland lived in Majorca, although it was reported in the British press in 1921 that he planned to make his home in London. After his London debut in July 1920, he returned to give two recitals in March and April of 1921. Bach, Mozart, Chopin and Liszt were on the programme. A reviewer found his Mozart Fantasy in C minor K. 475 ‘rather too well poised’, while Chopin’s Ballade No. 1 in G minor Op. 23 was criticised for its ‘battering-ram climax’, an encore of a mazurka being far preferred. 
However, it was the group of Debussy and Spanish music that was ‘…the more interesting because they showed his individuality as a pianist’. In the very week that Copeland was playing his arrangement of Debussy’s Prélude à l’Après-midi d’un faune at Aeolian Hall, pianist Leonard Borwick was giving two recitals at the same hall. Borwick also made an arrangement of this Debussy composition that was recorded by Mark Hambourg in 1922. Copeland’s arrangement was appreciated as ‘skillfully made and beautifully executed.’ The following month’s recital included Schumann’s Études Symphoniques, Ravel’s Rigaudon and John Ireland’s The Island Spell in addition to a group of Debussy and Spanish compositions. A critic echoed Philip Hale’s comments when he wrote, ‘Perhaps the outstanding qualities of Mr George Copeland’s pianoforte playing… are his clarity of rhythm, not only in detail, but in respect of the treatment of a movement as a whole.’

In 1929 Copeland returned to play in Boston for the first time in over ten years. At this time he also played at Carnegie Hall and a year later was heard with the Philadelphia Orchestra and Leopold Stokowski in Falla’s Noches en los jardines de España. In the 1930s Copeland was based in Europe, making visits to America for performances and recordings. In the 1940s he resided permanently in New York giving a recital each season and collaborating with Serge Koussevitzky and the Boston Symphony Orchestra in Mozart’s Piano Concerto in E flat K. 482 and with Maggie Teyte in a Debussy programme in 1945. His Golden Jubilee recital at Carnegie Hall in 1957 was a great success and his final recital in New York was given in March 1963. His final public performance took place in May 1964 at Yale University.

Copeland’s first recordings were made for Victor in March 1933 when he recorded mainly Spanish music. A few weeks later, on 21 March, he returned to record a large amount of Debussy including his own arrangement for solo piano of Prélude à l’Après-midi d’un faune, six of the préludes, Soirée dans Grenade and Clair de lune. Further sessions for Victor in 1936 and 1938 produced more Debussy, plus Satie, Milhaud, and Spanish music by Mompou, Albéniz, Nin, Turina, Granados and Villa-Lobos as well as music by such lesser-known composers as Zuera, Lehmberg, Lecuona, Pittaluga and Infante. A powerful performance of Malagueña by Albéniz shows how Copeland is perfectly suited to the Spanish idiom. Some Bach was also recorded, two movements from the English Suite No. 5 and a Bach transcription by Walter Rummel.

These recordings show Copeland to be all the things Philip Hale recognised: in French and Spanish compositions he is an ideal pianist. His clarity of sound is most noticeable, and his rhythmically-controlled, lucid approach to these works is similar to that of Ricardo Viñes, and a long way from that of Walter Gieseking’s pellucid recordings of twenty years later. Indeed, although he rarely taught, a pupil of Copeland, George Bennette, stated, ‘Mr Copeland points out that the music of the Spanish composers, particularly, suffers when too much rubato is used, and its real affect is spoiled by sentimentalising. This does not mean that Mr Copeland does not believe in rubato, but he uses it sparingly.’ The same pupil paraphrased Copeland on sound production at the piano, stating, ‘…too many pianists today listen, but they do not hear. Otherwise why do they allow themselves to produce, continuously, such harsh, ugly sounds at their instruments?’
More recordings were made for MGM in 1950, but all of Copeland’s solo Victor recordings from the 1930s have been released on two compact discs by Pearl with the addition of two live performances from his final recital in 1964. The live recordings are stunning in their virtuosity and control. The success of the Pearl release led to another on the same label of private recordings from 1957–1963 and here Copeland can be heard not only in more Debussy that he did not record commercially, but also in Mozart and Schumann.

<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>BRIGID BROPHY, from the multiple eminences of her keen intellect, her erudition h?? artistic perceptions. her saturation in Freudian psychology, her wide culture and her brilliant prose, has chosen to psychoanalyze the 18th century as represented by the Enlightenment. None will dispute her right or her method. But to drag Mozart into this by the hairs of his straggly pigtail (see the 1789 dry‐point by Dora Stock) seems to this Mozartian an act of arrogant and peculiarly clumsy intellectual acrobatics.

Subtitled “A New View of Mozart, his Operas and his Age,” Miss Brophy&#39;s book expounds the new view with dazzling literary virtuosity. But her basic premise appears highly debatable: the premise that the operas of Mozart “lifted his genius to its highest and most sustained pitch.” Why? How? Miss Brophy has the answers for us in a closely‐reasoned volume, ascribing to the characters of Mozart operas a degree of psychological importance which they may well hold for some contemporary minds, but which it is impossible to prove they held for Mozart.

Starting from the exaggeration that opera was the form of music that Mozart pre‐eminently wanted to compose (we presume only because of opera&#39;s greater conspicuousness and the contingent likelihood of larger earnings for the composer), this book proceeds to a deep psychological study of the Enlightenment. This is summarized, in a series of short‐punching chapters, as a multiple parricide (rebellion against various father‐figures). with its concomitant fear of castration, and of impotence. From this the theory moves on to a dialectical analysis of the characters of Don Giovanni, the Count Almaviva, Figaro, Cherubim, et al., with due consideration for the female characters of the operas, who are discussed in psychosexual terms that tempt one to imagine what Mozart, a writer of scatslogical letters, might have said on the subject.

Miss Brophy expounds a theory of her own—there is no extensive documentation to prove her correct—that Mozart took much more part in the writing of his libretti and the limning of his characters than has always been supposed. She leans so hard upon this in two Chapters on “The Magic Flute” that she overreaches herself entirely and, at least for this reader, takes her stand upon wholly untenable ground.

Least tenable of all her positions is her claim that the operas of Mozart hold the key to deepest understanding of him or his art, and thus of his epoch and his place as a voice of the Enlightenment. If personal taste dictates a preference for opera over nondramatic music as an art form, one does not wish to argue with personal taste. There is no dispute with timeproven opinions that “Don Giovanni” is the grandest opera ever written, “Figaro” the supreme comic opera and “The Magic Flute” the most timeless of mysteries.

It is, however, the case that the purest essence of Mozart is to be heard in his chamber music; in concertos and other works for his own instrument, the pianoforte; and in the later symphonies, particularly the three masterpieces of the summer of 1788. It is possible to nourish oneself on pure Mozart by listening to any competent group of musicians performing the G Minor Quintet, the six quartets dedicated to Haydn, the C Minor Piano Concerto and the G Minor Symphony—to make a random sampling. It is quite impossible to be so nourished upon Mozart&#39;s operas, dearly as we love them, for the reason that opera requires superhuman performance; and superhumanity in the form of singers and conductors is too rarely come by to be depended upon for daily bread.

I, too, like Miss Brophy, have worshipped at the shrine of the Glyndebourne festivals, and also at as many other operatic temples as can be comprised in a long musical life. As a single example of the futility of overstressing Mozart&#39;s operatic music, I have never heard the music of the Queen of the Night in “The Magic Flute” sung by a voice capable of singing it, dramatically as well as in range and technique. Miss Brophy&#39;s obsession with the operas is, therefore, the personalizing of Mozart, the trapping of his genius in a medium that depends for realization upon the usually unrealizable. It suggests a curious Immaturity of musical comprehension.

For sheer good prose, for lucidity of mind, for gristle for the intellectual teeth, Miss Brophy excels. After intent reading of this book on Mozart the dramatist, I have thought it over well and come to the conclusion that it is a precious and pretentious work devoid of humanity and humor. I am at moments disarmed by my admiration for the writing, for its author&#39;s learning, her broad historical and sociological culture. But I am bored by her insistence upon a psychoanalytical filter through which to evaluate Mozart. And I would venture that this screening will have little effect upon the majority of Mozartians who neither need nor seek Freudian interventions between them and their love of Mozart and his music.

<p>Nietzsche’s thinking about Hamlet goes beyond the brilliant, glancing remarks in The Birth of Tragedy and is bound up with the deepest themes of his philosophy. His ideas, moreover, have influenced twentieth-century criticism of the play, especially that which is troubled by the Ghost and which may even find something positive in Hamlet’s not immediately setting to work and dispatching Claudius. This essay attempts to explore some of the ways Hamlet mattered to Nietzsche. Like Coleridge, and many others who have identified with Shakespeare’s Prince, Nietzsche seems to have used Hamlet to interpret his own life. And his views on Fevenge, I will argue, illuminate a central issue of the play.</p>

Nietzsche is a mere, very ordinary, prediction of Dostoevsky. Think Götzen-Dammerung! 

“Put away your gods and come and worship ours, or we will kill you and your gods!&quot; And so it will be to the end of the world, even when gods disappear from the earth; they will fall down before idols just the same.”

He uses Romantic harmony (it is said that between him and Bach, all tools of the so-called Romantic harmony had already been used). Purcellian turns of melody and harmony, including false relations at cadences and love of hemiola (not exclusively at cadences), expressive play with words, broken unaccompanied cadences are frequent. Handel and Purcell often elected to dwell in the same way on the same words and ideas (especially death). Although his works during the Cannons period have some flaws, he set the language with a subtlety few native composers have equaled. His melodic simplicity points to the classical style. The dramatic charge in his simple music is noteworthy (the Dead March in Saul). Beethoven most appreciated the ability of Handel to create enormous effects through simplicity.</span>

Altogether he wrote almost fifty operas and half as many oratorios, much of his other music is also occasional music (like Water Music, Music for the Royal Fireworks). Even the organ concertos he wrote were written for use in the theatre to be played between the acts of his oratorios. Handel, therefore, is not interested in the academic side of his music, he doe not care about the academic procedures in his fugues, ignores the pure consecutive fifths (in Zadok) as long as the music has the theatrical character. For Handel his music had to be appreciated at first hearing. He was one of the first composers who responded the demands from the audience. For example, he knew that English taste showed a predisposition towards the chorus to which he replied promptly.

Even in his sonatas or suites for solo violin and cello (with no accompanying part), one does not feel that the texture is thin. He had a similar interest to various instruments like Vivaldi but he was more interested in their combinations (as in the Brandenburgs). Compared to Handel who followed the Corellian style in Baroque concerto, Bach makes use of the ritornello structure more and uses wind instruments more. In chorales, he made extensive use of chromaticism and dissonance to emphasize emotional significance of words. A typical Bach melody in slow movements on a ground bass is highly elaborate and rococo: frequent groups of demisemiquavers, a lot of mordents, appoggiaturas, subservient to no metrical pattern, but pausing to cadence only. From diverse stylistic elements of Baroque music, he created an individual style. His style is the result of his technical competence, intellectual concentration, musical imagination and emotional sensitivity.</span>

In his vocal-mindedness (which is quite different from the instrumental-mindedness of Bach and Vivaldi), Handel appears as a composer whose main concern was the human voice.

<p>It is interesting that the same text was set to music by both composers. This is Eilt ihr angefocht’nen Seelen in the Passion Oratorio (by Handel) and in the St. John Passion (by Bach). They used the same key and the same pictorial representation of ‘haste’, and the choral interjections at dramatic points are also common. According to Bukofzer, however, Handel’s music is inferior because it lacks the highly individual stamp that distinguished Bach from all other composers.

<p>Dorry and Allans parodies aren’t anything like those of Aristophanes. They are pretty much Euripides:</p>
<p>His contemporaries associated him with Socrates as a leader of a decadent intellectualism, both of them being frequently lampooned by comic poets such as Aristophanes. Whereas Socrates was eventually put on trial and executed as a corrupting influence, Euripides chose a voluntary exile in old age, dying in Macedonia</p>
<p>Parody and satire, in gazing at performers, are the output of critics. Whereas tragedy faces life itself and is the work of poets — true artists</p>

El Dragón: Return of a Warrior 

SUMMARY
A tale of the origin of a jefe de jefas, ensuing succession battles, differential impacts on the strong, and the weak-willed; family dysfunction and alienation, use and abuse of CNS stimulants, search and discovery of a less harmful drug of refuge, and evolution of a plethora of love triangles wherein true love wins and the fake loses 

MAJOR critiques 
Detailed and frequent references to the past insult the imagination and intelligence of the viewer, would be a much richer and more succinct script if truly in medias res, several of the scenes feel like unpardonable long detours from the main narrative, which means these other characters aren’t developed enough to capture our interest, otherwise the exoticism of the Japanese origin of the protagonist offers sufficient stardust and mystery to hold this reviewer for an entire season 

OTHER critiques
For ambition and scope it scores quite high. But the creators, writers, and directors don’t lend sufficient depth to all the seven dimensions, the full breadth of “scope”, to make this a top notch TV series

<p>It should not be surprising that theomachy is difficult to identify in biblical passages because most of the theomachy categories only operate in a polytheistic system. Despite the fact that throughout much of Israel’s history they had not succeeded n discarding polytheism, the biblical text does not adopt a polytheistic worldview for itself.</p>
<p>Any reading of Genesis 1 makes it clear that the author has not employed a theomachy motif in this cosmogony. The absence of this motif could only. E labeled as polemical if theomachy were a consistent motif in cosmogonies. Its absence cannot be used as evidence that it has been suppressed. We have seen that it is not a consistent motif, and therefore we must seek an alternative cognitive environment for Genesis 1 in relation to the cosmogonic cognitive environment of the Ancient Near East</p>

<p>Was Bach a genius?<br />
If it is misanthropy, then Johann Sebastian Bach (born March 21, 1685) was not a genius. … But if genius is rational and productive, then Bach is a composer for all seasons, for no other composer produced so much excellent, cunning music or understood his craft so encyclopedically.</p>

Confusion about life and everything
So there’s room for poetry, adventure, love
But as she approaches 30 all that is lost

Lost to an emergent certitude
About what she wants out of life
We see her become prosaic—
More calculating, glorifying spreadsheets
Fear of missing milestones than passion

No: Modern woman, no barbarian 👩🏾

Tequila — from Monarca (powerful metaphor for the three heirs)

Silver/Blanco 
Rested/
Aged/

Each one with its flaws and virtues:

1.Silver tequila is young. Some find it immature, while others find it pure. 

2.The aging process has distanced rested tequila from its source, but deep down it retains its essence 

3.The wait has been long for aged tequila, but it has developed its own identity. Some claim that so many years spent in the barrel have made it impure, far from the agave from which it was born. 

But which one is best? All three are excellent. My compliments to the master tequilier. Dhatemwa Kulala

<p>DiCaprio’s reign, especially over the last decade, has run almost comically contrary to what defines Hollywood success and Hollywood stardom. He has never made a sequel, he has never explicitly made a franchise flick, his films tend to be R-rated, often brutal or violent, targeted at adults and often featuring bleak endings. No spoilers, but his onscreen mortality rate would make Sean Bean proud. Not unlike Denzel Washington (relatively speaking), DiCaprio has maintained his movie star draw by continuing to make himself the “franchise” or the “brand.” And that brand is generally “DiCaprio giving it his all in a high-quality, big-budget event movie for grown-ups courtesy of a marquee director.”</p>

<p>No character in The Brothers Karamazov is afflicted with more trauma or inner conflict than Ivan. Ivan is a brilliant student with an incisively analytical mind, and his intelligence is directly to blame for his descent into despair. Unable to reconcile the horror of unjust human suffering—particularly the suffering of children—with the idea of a loving God, Ivan is consumed with doubt and argues that even if God does exist, he is malicious and hostile, and loves to torture mankind. Ivan believes that human concepts of morality are dependent on the idea that the soul is immortal, meaning that people only worry about “right” and “wrong” behavior because they want to experience pleasure rather than pain in the afterlife. Because of his feelings about God, Ivan himself is unable to believe in the immortality of the soul, and thus he argues that good and evil are fraudulent categories, and that people may do whatever they wish without regard for morality. But Ivan only starts thinking about these concepts in the first place because he loves humanity—it is his concern for human suffering that initially leads him to reject God. His logical disbelief in morality is terribly painful for him because it would make a way of life such as Fyodor Pavlovich’s, which Ivan detests, an acceptable mode of human behavior. Dignified and coldly moral, Ivan wants to be able to accept an idea of goodness that would exalt mankind and reject Fyodor Pavlovich’s brutishness, but, trapped in his own logic, he is unable to do so. He is so beset with doubt, and so defensively determined to keep the rest of humanity at a distance, that he is unable to act on his love for Katerina, and seems to scorn the very thought of pursuing happiness for himself.</p>
<p>After Smerdyakov murders Fyodor Pavlovich, Ivan’s crisis of faith becomes more traumatic still. Convinced by Smerdyakov that Ivan’s philosophy made it possible for Smerdyakov to kill Fyodor Pavlovich, Ivan is forced to confront two very difficult notions: first, that he is responsible for another human being, and second, that his beliefs have paved the way for murder. Ivan’s subsequent collapse into hallucination and madness represents the novel’s final rejection of his skeptical way of life. When the novel ends, Ivan is feverish and unconscious, having been taken home by Katerina to recuperate, and his future is uncertain. It may be that, with Katerina’s love, he will find a way to accept Alyosha’s faith or come to terms intellectually with morality and his own responsibility for others. Or it may be that he will never resolve his crisis—he may become permanently insane. But the extremely optimistic note on which the novel ends suggests that he will find some form of redemption.</p>

<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>— If you want to move quickly, move alone; if you want to move far, move collectively — 

Distinguished gentlemen, on August 1st we had meeting #3 defacto moderated by Patrick;
He invited each person in attendance to summarize their thoughts on a particular matter; and,
The matter at hand was: “To what end are these zoom meetings aimed?”

No one has attended all three meetings, with the possible exceptions of Patrick, Duncan, and Kadi;
Some have attended two, others one, and still some none;
Whether or not 9PM Saturday is an ideal time for these two weekly meetings is an issue to discuss;
One proposal to improve attendance is to move these meetings to 9PM Sunday;
But that is an issue that we can discuss before August 15 (Saturday) or August 16 (Sunday).

I attempted to link the ideas across all three meetings;
But Patrick thought it would be better for each idea to be expressed by its author;
Yet being perhaps the only person who attended each minute of each meeting,
Perhaps it would be a great loss if I neglected items already shared, methinks.
And therefore I’ll merely paraphrase in an abstract manner what that “thread” of thoughts adds up to…

BECOMING..
1.Legal (Creating a registered entity, say an LLC)
2.Online (That entity getting an online presence in form of webApp, App, Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook)
3.Traffic (Eyeballs and clicks; i.e., becoming something that can drive traffic to our webApp/online avatar)
4.Content (What we are offering that might drive traffic to us on a sustainable basis)
5.Money (Generating BIG revenues and earnings within 5-10 years of initiating operations)

— What follows are summaries of what was on the minds of others in the meeting — 

DUNCAN  
1.Networks (The 17 Boyz in this forum)
2.Scalable (To include other Budonians of our year, other years, and of course, non-Budonians)
3.Differentiable (Creating products and services that can be differentiated from what is available on the market)
4.Platform (Creating a platform that brings all the above to life)
5.Translatable (Earnings, Income)

ABEL
1.Proof of Principle (We can start something simple.. are already in the process of doing so)
2.Can be adapted (What we start can grow in directions we didn’t envisage at the start; i.e., adaptive to new opportunities and threats)
3.Not necessarily for Profit (Adds value in terms of brotherhood; i.e., we move beyond MERELY talking about Nyaru chics!!)
4.Link to K’la for Diaspora (For those who live outside the motherland, there is a CRAVING to connect with home in as many intimate ways as possible)
5.Excellent Platform (Can be leveraged in future; the platform we develop can be put to great use as we get new ideas in the future)

MARK
1.Just wanted to make money (Many folks are married with kids and they have bills to pay; so there’s little time and resources to be wasted)
2.Delinquent loans, Distressed debt in the +256 (A potential asset class that might be the basis of a high-yield business endeavor) 
3.We have Budonian &amp; non-Budonian friends who are Bank CFOs &amp; CEOs
4.Those CFOs and CEOs have approached us, broached the subject of potential investment vehicles that can work with their banks
5.So far we’ve been caught flat-footed… perhaps because we have been pre-occupied with Nyaru chics

TIM
1.We already have networks (So we must clarify what value we might add with our networks)
2.Formalizing them makes us millennials (Therefore we must do something other than just post stuff on Instagram)
3.Generating revenue (Of course this comes to mind as our area of focus.. although millennials are also doing this quite successfully)
4.Specific targets (Short gun vs. ROI approach… i.e., we should have a razor-focus on return on investment)
5.No luxury for legacy (Many of us are not yet at the Bill Gates stage of trying to leave a legacy for humanity; therefore, lets be focused for now on making money)

PATRICK (issue.. taking deposits vs. giving loans vs bridge financing.. ABE clarification, with serious regulatory implications… fixed annuity from TIM).. our strongest skills 
1.Generationally how can we make something we might be proud of in the future (i.e., for generations beyond us)?
2.Looks like we are making progress (i.e., having these discussions); but how come women start earlier than us (Namagunga girls started at 30 what we are attempting at 40)?
3.Whatever we make, we only have time for BIG things!! This thing has to be CLEAR!! If it is not clear in terms of goals and processes, we must abandon it!!!
4.How about us doing an online bank? Not a brick &amp; mortar kind of thing? To serve the impatient younger generation that can’t stand queuing?
5.This bank would guarantee young customers a rate of return (Telecoms would potentially be our rivals since they are in this arena)

— Here is what the moderator says we are going to next — 
1.Put our individual ideas on paper (whoever you are.. strategy and we refine it as a group)
2.Lets move away from talking (registering a domain name can’t be considered as making progress)
3.Our starting point the next time is what we put on paper (thats how a business idea comes to mind.. revenue streams options)
4.More people on the phone and participation in next meeting will be nice
5.Reviews from a larger audience will move us forward

<p>Adams was a dedicated diarist and regularly corresponded with many important figures in early American history, including his wife and adviser Abigail Adams, and Thomas Jefferson.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Adams never owned a slave and declined on principle to use slave labor, saying, “I have, through my whole life, held the practice of slavery in such abhorrence, that I have never owned a negro or any other slave, though I have lived for many years in times, when the practice was not disgraceful, when the best men in my vicinity thought it not inconsistent with their character, and when it has cost me thousands of dollars for the labor and subsistence of free men, which I might have saved by the purchase of negroes at times when they were very cheap.” Before the war, he occasionally represented slaves in suits for their freedom. Adams generally tried to keep the issue out of national politics, because of the anticipated Southern response during a time when unity was needed to achieve independence.</p>

TITLE: Continuous environmental scanning for PM2.5

BACKGROUND: Air pollution kills approximately one million in Africa each year. Fine particles, designated PM2.5, with a diameter of 2.5 μm or less penetrate deep into the lungs and blood streams unfiltered, causing heart attacks, respiratory disease, and premature death more frequently — but alas also more subtly —  than, say, poor nutrition or sedentary life do. Exponential growth in the second-hand car industry, among other factors, is a worrisome driver of this silent epidemic. But it is hard to know how bad the problem is with African governments prioritizing virtually all other better known and more visible problems they are faced with.

METHODS: We will deploy one hundred real-time sensors of 24-Hour PM2.5 Levels (μg/m3) from across select Ugandan districts and along high-traffic routes in select cities (unit cost starting at $25) to document how exposed unwitting Ugandan citizens are to hazardous levels of environmental pollution. From the convenience of a webApp, any Ugandan citizen or foreigner visiting Uganda or planning to visit Uganda will have free access to this information. Regulatory authorities in Uganda will be notified of this service, as will the public — via subtle but powerful media compaigns about this “silent killer.”

RESULTS: Eyeballs, clicks, online traffic, governmental &amp; corporate attention to the quality of one of our services. Access to grants (e.g. NIH) and collaboration with ongoing research to fund this endeavor and make it cost neutral. 

INFERENCES: Proof of concept for our online platform where one service can drive traffic towards other unrelated service, thereby potentially achieving network effects.

<p>I have a long history with this concerto (K.466), having played a movement — and won with it — in competition at the age of 15. And when I was secretary of state, I had a chance to play a few lines from it on Mozart’s own piano at the festival in Vienna celebrating the 250th anniversary of his birth. Needless to say, the piece means a lot to me. The restlessness of the first movement, the simplicity of the second and the playfulness of the third are for me quintessential Mozart: genius. And Martha Argerich’s rendering is incomparable</p>

<p>How do Hamlet vs. Achilles compare?<br />
An interesting question. My short answer is, “With difficulty.” To expand on that, they are such different men in such different cultures and circumstances that it is tough to make useful comparisons. Both are major figures in their realms. Both are skilled warriors. Both are intelligent. Both are proud, and both are close to their fathers. Both delay crucial violence. Beyond that, however…it’s hard to say. Hamlet is forever divided and in his head. Achilles, by contrast, is driven by emotion. Hamlet wants to be absolutely right before he acts. Achilles acts, and trusts his actions to be right. Hamlet seems fond of Ophelia, but his ego is not bound to hers. By contrast, Achilles doesn’t seem fond of any woman, but his ego is bound to them as his prize. In other words, as ascetic priest vs warrior</p>

<p>Shakespeare was born into an emerging United Kingdom, with peaceful succession to the throne within the house of Tudor. So the only warriors he venerates — Harry Hotspur &amp; Henry V — are from a bygone error. His is an age of wicked men angling for power through intrigue in the court. In Macbeth and Hamlet the battlefield is only referred to as a recent memory. Intrigue rules</p>

<p>Nietzsche as <a class="reference external" href="https://brians.wsu.edu/2016/10/12/the-influence-of-nietzsche/">#1 in the Pantheon</a> of Great Philosophers</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Jacob Golomb observed, “Nietzsche’s ideas were widely disseminated among and appropriated by the first Hebrew Zionist writers and leaders.”[31] According to Steven Aschheim, “Classical Zionism, that essentially secular and modernizing movement, was acutely aware of the crisis of Jewish tradition and its supporting institutions. Nietzsche was enlisted as an authority for articulating the movement’s ruptured relationship with the past and a force in its drive to normalization and its activist ideal of self-creating Hebraic New Man.”</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>The absence of quotation marks—or “perverted commas” as Joyce styled them—and discursive markers, such as the phrase “he said,” are signs of Joyce’s confidence in his being able to differentiate characters purely on the basis of their own individuating and identificative patois, as well as of his faith in his readers’ interpretive prowess.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>It is obvious that in his day-dreams he is a warrior, not a professor; all of the men he admires were military. His opinion of women, like every man’s, is an objectification of his own emotion towards them, which is obviously one of fear. “Forget not thy whip”– but nine women out of ten would get the whip away from him, and he knew it, so he kept away from women, and soothed his wounded vanity with unkind remarks. […] [H]e is so full of fear and hatred that spontaneous love of mankind seems to him impossible. He has never conceived of the man who, with all the fearlessness and stubborn pride of the superman, nevertheless does not inflict pain because he has no wish to do so. Does any one suppose that Lincoln acted as he did from fear of hell? Yet to Nietzsche, Lincoln is abject, Napoleon magnificent. […] I dislike Nietzsche because he likes the contemplation of pain, because he erects conceit into duty, because the men whom he most admires are conquerors, whose glory is cleverness in causing men to die. But I think the ultimate argument against his philosophy, as against any unpleasant but internally self-conscious ethic, lies not in an appeal to facts, but in an appeal to the emotions. Nietzsche despises universal love; I feel it the motive power to all that I desire as regards the world. His followers have had their innings, but we may hope that it is coming rapidly to an end.

<p>I like a good drama. And this documentary is about two warring factions in American christianity: one that views faith in Jesus as a guarantee of rewards here on <em>earth</em> vs. another that only sees Jesus as a means to <em>heaven</em>.</p>
<p>The ones who look to earthly and material things — health, wealth, miracles —  as the expected rewards fancy themselves sort of masters of the universe, victorious warriors and heroes, channeling the Holy Spirit so that their example here on earth might attract the weary to the faith (and, of course, to tithe under their stewardship).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the ones who look to heaven insist that only christ alone is the hero. And that by his stripes we might find a way to heaven, but that the earthly portion of the journey goes according to Gods will and not ours — we are not masters of this universe. Thus health, wealth, and miracles are not necessarily promised. Instead, our faith should clarify the path we should take, a path that will involve acts of love to other more needy folks.. as Jesus taught.</p>

<p>The Child in The Mirror: A Nietzschean Reading of the Myth of Michael Jackson</p>
<p>The character of my fondness for Michael Jackson and Friedrich Nietzsche is very similar. Despite both of these men being extremely influential and leaving behind highly celebrated bodies of work, they are also both often considered tragic cases on the historical stage. They were driven to obsessive heights, if not madness, by their devotion to their craft and their vision for the world. Yet I have never looked upon either of them with anything short of deep respect. Even in their tragedy, these men are beautiful to me. I hope to… reveal two visionaries reaching out to one another from across historical eras and spheres of influence. In the act of aligning these two boldly trailblazing artists, I hope to lend an admirable and rich philosophy to a pop star, and to lend the romance and marvel of pop to the life’s work of a philosopher.</p>

The July 2010 issue of Yeti Magazine includes a series of photographs taken on tour by Dean Wareham of pop duo Dean &amp; Britta. Among them is a snap of a French newsstand, where Michael Jackson and Friedrich Nietzsche sat side by side on neighboring magazine covers:</p>
<p>In his description of the photograph, Wareham went on to imagine a conversation between the two thinkers, sharing the finer points of dancing and the inner child:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>FN: Be on your guard against the learned! They hate you; for they are unfruitful.
MJ: Lies run sprints, but the truth runs marathons.
FN: In every real man a child is hidden that wants to play.
MJ: There’s a Mother’s Day and a Father’s Day but there’s no Children’s Day. It would mean a lot. World peace.
FN: I would believe only in a God that knows how to dance.2

<p>Charming, yes, but I believe this comparison runs much deeper than that, into a juxtaposition of two historical figures that is entirely natural and extremely rich. In this article, I will endeavor to delve further into these imagined cahoots between the King of Pop and Nietzsche.</p>

<p>Nietzsche was no stranger to the virtues of music. Among his most oft-quoted words are: “Life without music would be an error,” and “I would not know what the spirit of a philosopher might wish more to be than a good dancer”.3 Nietzsche, from his earliest writings, considered himself a disciple of Dionysus, the ancient Greek God of pleasure. To Nietzsche, Dionysus symbolized everything ecstatic, exuberant, and rich with life. “In the Dionysian symbol,” he wrote, “there is attained the extreme limit of affirmation.” He adored art which embodied this attitude, principally music, which speaks to the emotions on a particularly instinctual level. Perhaps due to this fact, Nietzsche himself attached a great deal of personal importance to his own musical compositions.</p>
<p>Though considered to be mediocre at best as a composer, he was extremely concerned with the public’s reception of his work. In a letter to his friend Peter Gast in 1882 regarding his orchestral piece “Hymn to Life”, he wrote: “This time, ‘music’ is coming to you. I would hope that I have made a song that could be performed publicly — in order to seduce people to my philosophy”.4 As a musician himself, Nietzsche recognized music’s particular magic, and saw it as a complement to his philosophy which could expand his public influence.</p>
<p>While Nietzsche, the frustrated composer, never received much respect for his music, he did create something else relatively seductive: a piece of writing that is much closer to poetry or music than it is to analytic philosophy. It is Thus Spoke Zarathustra, perhaps his most popular yet most puzzling work of philosophy, composed between 1883 and 1885. It reads like a work of literature, telling the story of a solitary prophet named Zarathustra who emerges from his seclusion to spread his wisdom. Through a series of parables, Nietzsche leads us on a densely symbolic and ecstatic tour of his philosophical views which stands in contrast to his other work; despite his proclivity to speak in aphorisms (Beyond Good and Evil, Twilight of the Idols), Nietzsche’s canon arguably consists of relatively linear works of philosophy. Nowhere else do we find an extended metaphorical narrative within his work akin to Zarathustra. We’ll call Zarathustra, for our purposes here, Nietzsche’s closest approximation to a pop song. It is with a focus on Zarathustra that I begin his comparison with Michael Jackson — with artist speaking to artist, both expressing their philosophies with all the grace and mystique of a great dancer, through shared virtue and shared tragedy.</p>

<p>Nietzsche was always very sparing in what he published, but he loved playing around with book titles. He wrote many more titles than books.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>I had no idea Nietzsche could be funny until I read his letters. “The gentlest, most reasonable man may, if he wears a large moustache, sit as it were in its shade and feel safe,” he wrote, self-mockingly. “As the accessory of a large moustache he will give the impression of being military, irascible and sometimes violent – and will be treated accordingly.”</p>

<p>Dear all<br />
Today we had a question about the interpretation of the pdf. Consider the case when we have a random variable <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(X\)</span> with pdf <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(x)\)</span>. Note that the pdf, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(x)\)</span>, is the derivative of the cdf, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F(x)\)</span>. Assume that we are in a small interval <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([x_1,x_2]\)</span>. Then in this interval <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f(x_1)\)</span> is approximated by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\{F(x_2)-F(x_1)\}/(x_2-x_1)\)</span>
The numerator in this formula is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(F(x_2)-F(x_1)\)</span>, which is equal to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(X\in [x_1,x_2])\)</span>. This probability can be estimated by the proportion of observations that fall in the interval <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([x_1,x_2]\)</span> and is a number between 0 and 1. However, this probability is divided by the length of the interval <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([x_1,x_2]\)</span>, that is <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(x_2-x_1\)</span>. The ratio between the frequency of observations in the interval <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([x_1,x_2]\)</span> and the length of the interval <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\([x_1,x_2]\)</span> is not guaranteed to be between 0 and 1. In fact, it can be any number between 0 and infinity.<br />

<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>To Mrs Daphine Kabugo
From Duncan’s friends outside Uganda

We are not sure how exactly Duncan vibbed you &amp; made you fall in love with him


But we all suspect that he spoke to you in the tongues of angels

And seemed to you that he understood all mysteries and knowledge in  the world

Maybe he even gave all his possessions to the poor!! And  dedicated his weekends to serving the needy.

Daphine, If is from such things that you fell in love with Duncan, then well done!!

Because Duncan is all these things and more…

Duncan is patient, Duncan is kind. He does not envy. He does not boast, he is not proud, he does not dishonor others; he is not self-seeking, is is not easily angered, he keeps no record of wrongs. He does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth.

I speak on behalf of all his friends and with 100% sincerity.

Duncan is fiercely loyal. 
He will defend you, protect you, support you, cheer you, worship you, tell everyone about you, rejoice in your success — in a word, he will LOVE you to death.

Daphine, you are an extremely lucky girl in having Duncan as a friend and wife.

We wish you both the best years to come,.. and look forward to rejoicing in your happiness

You have no enemies, you say? Alas, my friend, the boast is poor. 

He who has mingled in the fray of duty that the brave endure, 

must have made foes. If you have none, 
small is the work that you have done. 

You’ve hit no traitor on the hip. You’ve dashed no cup from perjured lip. 

You’ve never turned the wrong to right. You’ve been a coward in the fight.

He died of the swelling which was an abomination to the earth goddess. When a man was afflicted with swelling in the stomach and the limbs he was not allowed to die in the house. He was carried to the Evil Forest and left there to die. There was the story of a very stubborn man who staggered back to his house and had to be carried again to the forest and tied to a tree. The sickness was an abomination to the earth, and so the victim could not be buried in her bowels. He died and rotted away above the earth, and was not given the first or the second burial. Such was Unoka’s fate. When they carried him away, he took with him his flute.”

<p>The essence of civilization, as we know, is dullness. In an ultimate analysis, it is only an elaborate invention … for abolishing the fierce passions, the unchastened enjoyments, the awakening dangers, the desperate conflicts, … the excitements of a barbarous age, and to substitute for them indoor pleasures, placid feelings, and rational amusements. That a grown man should be found to write reviews is in itself a striking fact. Suppose you asked Achilles to do such a thing, do you imagine he would consent?<br />

<p>“I have explained how it was that Socrates could repel: it is therefore all the more necessary to explain how he could fascinate. That he discovered a new kind of contest, that he became its first fencing master for the noble circles of Athens, is one point. He fascinated by appealing to the competitive impulse of the Greeks — he introduced a variation into the wrestling match between young men and youths. Socrates was a great erotic.”</p>

<p>Dawson’s Creek — lousiest TV series ever?<br />
Probably just laughable ever!<br />
The protagonist is so gay —<br />
Always rescued from having sex by the cosmos<br />
But that never bothered him<br />
He just wants to talk!!<br />
Mostly about his feelings :-)</p>

<p>Change — destruction of forbears’ edifice<br />
Beauty — remnant building blocks<br />
Aesthetics — new edifice, the becoming</p>
<p>“I am often asked why, after all, I write in German: nowhere am I read worse than in the Fatherland. But who knows in the end whether I even wish to be read today? To create things on which time tests its teeth in vain; in form, in substance, to strive for a little immortality — I have never yet been modest enough to demand less of myself. The aphorism, the apothegm, in which I am the first among the Germans to be a master, are the forms of “eternity”; it is my ambition to say in ten sentences what everyone else says in a book — what everyone else does not say in a book.</p>
<p>I have given mankind the most profound book it possesses, my Zarathustra; shortly I shall give it the most independent.”</p>

<p>Dynamometer: strength vs ugliness</p>
<p>“Nothing is beautiful, except man alone: all aesthetics rests upon this naïveté, which is its first truth. Let us immediately add the second: nothing is ugly except the degenerating man — and with this the realm of aesthetic judgment is circumscribed. Physiologically, everything ugly weakens and saddens man. It reminds him of decay, danger, impotence; it actually deprives him of strength. One can measure the effect of the ugly with a dynamometer. Wherever man is depressed at all, he senses the proximity of something “ugly.” His feeling of power, his will to power, his courage, his pride — all fall with the ugly and rise with the beautiful. In both cases we draw an inference: the premises for it are piled up in the greatest abundance in instinct. The ugly is understood as a sign and symptom of degeneration: whatever reminds us in the least of degeneration causes in us the judgment of “ugly.” Every suggestion of exhaustion, of heaviness, of age, of weariness; every kind of lack of freedom, such as cramps, such as paralysis; and above all, the smell, the color, the form of dissolution, of decomposition — even in the ultimate attenuation into a symbol — all evoke the same[…]”</p>

<p>The Economists recurrent wonderment at the elusive “Happiness” — say, for instance, why Ugandans may seem <a class="reference external" href="https://www.economist.com/christmas-specials/2013/12/21/bleak-chic">happier than Parisians</a> — often yields essays that are too clever by a half. But really the error of the question of happiness is the error of teleology, of eternity, of idealism, of concepts, of systematizing, of metaphysical philosophy. This is the primal sin and all human errors have inverted this “end” into a “beginning”, a foundation.</p>
<p>The simple cure, then, is a return to the testimony of — first and foremost — the chemistry, of today, of reality, of senses, of simplicity, of historical philosophy. This is whence primeval man comes and where the primitive and savage tribes are in close proximity, and therefore happier! But also more miserable at the same time. There is flux, stimulation, there is strife, there is life!! <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id25" id="id18">11</a></p>

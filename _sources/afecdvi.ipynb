    "In this bibliography analysis, the authors study \"Research productivity of the United States of America in the field of organ transplantation.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "How these efforts may translate into better clinical care, more refined guidelines, or more effective policies for the care of our patients is not clear. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing seems novel either. It is well known that the USA has the largest volume of patients in the field of transplantation and has led in peer-reviewed output since the 1950s. Ranking transplant centers, researchers, and journals in the USA based on number of citations is something that might be of interest to some, and a need that may be met by magazines such as US News and World Report. But it is not the kind of work that Clinical Transplantation is interested in publishing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Granted, when we look at the methodological rigor of this paper, we find fundamental flaws. Table 5, for instance, describes the \"top-15 cited articles in the field of trnsplantation by authors from the USA.\" As an author of articles in the field of transplantation, I have published papers in General medical journals with more citations than most of these listed articles and these have not been captured. Which is to say, the denominator of this study is not the most appropriate. The denominator should be the number of articles published in the field of transplantation by authors in any peer-reviewed journal (and from any country!). \n",
    "\n",
    "But what would be the point of such a study? From an editorial perspective, we are not in the business of counting citations. We are in the business of improving the health of our patients."

    "\n",
    "In this bibliography analysis, the authors study \"Research productivity of the United States of America in the field of organ transplantation.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "How these efforts may translate into better clinical care, more refined guidelines, or more effective policies for the care of our patients is not clear. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nothing seems novel either. It is well known that the USA has the largest volume of patients in the field of transplantation and has led in peer-reviewed output since the 1950s. Ranking transplant centers, researchers, and journals in the USA based on number of citations is something that might be of interest to some, and a need that may be met by magazines such as US News and World Report. But it is not the kind of work that Clinical Transplantation is interested in publishing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Granted, when we look at the methodological rigor of this paper, we find fundamental flaws. Table 5, for instance, describes the \"top-15 cited articles in the field of trnsplantation by authors from the USA.\" As an author of articles in the field of transplantation, I have published papers in General medical journals with more citations than most of these listed articles and these have not been captured. Which is to say, the denominator of this study is not the most appropriate. The denominator should be the number of articles published in the field of transplantation by authors in any peer-reviewed journal (and from any country!). \n",
    "\n",
    "But what would be the point of such a study? From an editorial perspective, we are not in the business of counting citations. We are in the business of improving the health of our patients.\n",

    "Arco: Teams or projects that follow a continuous, flowing methodology, emphasizing smooth transitions and long-term objectives.\n",

    "Vibrato: Projects that resonate and have a lasting impact, emphasizing depth and richness.\n",
    "Sordino: For discreet, background projects, much like the muted tones produced using a mute.\n",

    "Ritardando: Initiatives that start quickly but gradually slow down, allowing for reflection and recalibration.\n",
    "The central theme, Concerto, portrays the amalgamation of various elements to produce a masterpiece, while the subgroups, inspired by specific techniques and musical nuances, capture the varied approaches and paces of research projects.

    "It seems like you're encountering an issue related to SSH keys. An SSH key is a secure way to authenticate yourself when connecting to a remote server or machine. To resolve the error message you mentioned, you need to ensure that you are providing a valid OpenSSH public key format.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some steps to create an SSH key pair and obtain the public key in OpenSSH format:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Generate SSH Key Pair**:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you haven't generated an SSH key pair yet, you can do so using the `ssh-keygen` command on your local machine:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",

    "This command will generate a new RSA key pair with a 4096-bit key size. Replace \"your_email@example.com\" with your actual email address.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Locate the Public Key**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the key pair is generated, you'll find the public key in a file with a `.pub` extension in your home directory. By default, the file name is `id_rsa.pub`, but it might be different if you provided a custom name during key generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Ensure OpenSSH Format**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the public key file using a text editor and verify that it is in OpenSSH public key format. The contents should look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAAB...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you copied the key from a web page or an email, make sure no extra spaces or characters are present.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Using the Public Key**:\n",
    "\n",
    "When connecting to a remote server or service that requires your public key, ensure you copy the entire content of the public key file (usually `id_rsa.pub`) into the appropriate field or file on the server. The exact steps may vary depending on the service or platform you are using.\n",

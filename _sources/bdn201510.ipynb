    "This is a very tortured meme from the Inglorious basterds -- or some other Nazi film, not sure which. I saw dozens of variations on this 6-8 years ago at Hopkins. But this one is the most messed up: one would expect Hilter to voice m7's outrage, perhaps on learning about Mbabazi's moves against him in the NRM or on the national scene. But for some weird reason, a Museveni sycophant thought it would be dramatic for the outrage to be directed against an incumbent? Doesn't make sense. Hitler was the incumbent under attack in this meme   \n",

He expresses himself effortlessly through music, but seems to have trouble doing so through the fashion & designs he creates. Guess the interview is his compensation for failure in fashion & design.   \n",

But his creative forays into fashion & design aren't genius; thus, the tortured interview in an attempt to make sense of it all. We all don't get it.   \n",

    "Otherwise, he sort of confessed that he is bored by music, since he has done it all. Artists like Shakespeare retired at similar points in life. They didn't try their \"genius\" at something new. Kanye is suffering from the pangs of success and loss of purpose. Fortunately, it's very clear from this interview that he really loves his wife and child :-)  \n",

    "Just read something that I thought I might share, given how much it resonated with a similar experience I had in 2004 when I visited an apartheid museum in Gauteng. The museum outlined, using visuals, how South Africa as a nation formed: starting with native bushmen, followed by Bantu from west Africa, Boers from the Netherlands, the Brits, and a hodgepodge of other groups from Israel, India, heavy African countries, etc. each wave of visitors became native.    \n",
    "\n",
    "This led me to view the dominance in numbers of Bantu (Sotho and Tswana) as no different from the dominance in economics and politics of the Wazungu (Boers and Brits). Of course, it led me to reflect upon the situation in Uganda: there've been moments of Ganda dominance, Acholi dominance, Lugbara dominance, and, lately, Hima dominance.   \n",

It took the myopic conflict between just black and white in the United States and put it on another level because you saw the turmoil between the Armenians and the Turks, and the Cypriots and the Greeks, and the Swedes and the Danes, and the Koreans and the Japanese. Everybody had these hassles, and you saw it was a basic part of human nature, these conflicts. It opened my soul, it opened my mind.\"   \n",

Amused to see the kid in the video: he's from Baltimore, and was barely 16 when he was in the cast of The Wire. Videography was superb, in dramatic effects.   \n",

Indeed, most folks around the world would be very surprised by these rankings because few folks can readily name 3 products & services that this Ugandan entrepreneurial spirit has brought forth for the rest of humanity. Uganda isn't a nation of exporters. Just one of very creative households.    \n",

    "We import almost everything we consume, with the exception of Matooke. We even import juice and rice. So our spirit of entrepreneurship is driven more by an urge to survive than to drive humanity forward -- which is a harsh judgement on Museveni's government. Where a nations fury and activity is driven by households, firms, and government, Uganda's is driven mostly by foreign firms & Ugandan households, with most entrepreneurship taking on a household flavor. So I celebrate Ugandans will to live, under a poorly performing government.   \n",

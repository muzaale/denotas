    "It seems you feel slighted about this paper, and I apologize for that. But remember that this was a time we had a ton of papers to get out, many of which involved the national datasets that you were driving the bus for; we weren’t sure about the reliability of ascertainment of the WHOLE data; and you were on a less-than-one-paper-a-year trajectory. Also remember you had a first-authored JAMA paper that year, so it’s not like we haven’t let you take the lead on exciting things :-) Hopefully Allan will get this paper out soon.   \n",

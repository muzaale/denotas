In some respects it is difficult to say a priori, since if one could give a strict formula for how to produce the ‚Äúhighest specimens‚Äù of humanity then they would cease to be the highest.

As Nietzsche sometimes puts it, a priori formulas must occasionally give way to the nobility of the ‚Äúnose,‚Äù which recognizes the scent of greatness and vulgarity when it is near. My sense is that Nietzsche is best understood as a radical individualist; one who insists passionately that our duty in life is to become what we are. But what kind of person is that?

Sometimes it even takes more vulgar forms, for instance when someone engages in self-aggrandizing acts to draw attention to themselves from the mass of people who dared to ignore them. In some circumstances, resentment can lead to tremendous and terrifying outbursts of energy, which give it the appearance of strength and power.

    "The goal of humanity lies in its highest specimens.\n",
    "~Friedrich Nietzsche, Untimely Meditations\n",
    "Unlike the controversy surrounding Marx and Heidegger, the outrage associated with Nietzsche has given way to ubiquitous and lavish praise. Since the end of the Second World War, thanks in no small part to the tireless efforts of interpreters like Walter Kaufmann, there has been a flurry of more rigorous and charitable interpretations of Nietzsche. The range is truly impressive; perhaps no other philosopher has influenced so many different opinions. Nietzsche was a profound influence on figures like Gilles Deleuze and Michel Foucault who have become prominently associated with the political Left, who supported overcoming society‚Äôs remaining moral and traditional barriers to self-creation. Other figures influenced by Nietzsche moved to the political Right, including the libertarian Ayn Rand and the classicist Leo Strauss. Artists have invoked his work to call for radical new aesthetic forms to emerge, while others have appealed to him to decry the decadence of modern art and feeling. Perhaps most interestingly, Nietzsche has even gained some popular traction, with his books selling millions of copies despite their strange topics and myriad styles. Despite this, Nietzsche remains a thinker very much at odds with many of the political positions at play today. This is perhaps inevitable, as Nietzsche was ever the contrarian and would likely have approved of Kierkegaard‚Äôs solemn maxim that ‚Äúwhen you label me, you negate me.‚Äù\n",
    "Firstly, Nietzsche was certainly in no way a progressive in gestation. He would almost certainly have had nothing but contempt for the postmodern proponents of difference and toleration who invoke aspects of his thought. Nietzsche was a staunch elitist who frequently derided the ‚Äúherd‚Äù which made up most of mankind. And he¬†was openly contemptuous of many cultural practices and traditions; lampooning Buddhism, dismissing the British as a nation of mediocre shopkeepers, and of course endlessly denigrating Judeo-Christianity as religions of ‚Äúresentment‚Äù oriented by a ‚Äúslave‚Äù morality. Moreover, Nietzsche had little good to say about either socialism or radical democracy, regarding them as little more than watered down efforts at secularizing vulgar Christian tropes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, Nietzsche would not have been fond of contemporary liberalism‚Äîclassical or egalitarian‚Äîand liberal rights, either. For Nietzsche, the call for rights‚Äîwhether to private property or welfare‚Äîwere simply slavish demands by the weak for protection from the worthy and strong. As John Rawls pointed out in his critique of Nietzschian ‚Äúperfectionism,‚Äù there is a strong sense in Nietzsche that society does not exist to benefit all of its members. Instead, it exists to enable the few truly great men and women to rise and establish new and almost god-like kinds of values. It was offensive that such figures must be held back by the mediocrity of humankind; great men like Napoleon cared little for the rights and welfare of others as they rode out to remake the world. This, of course, did not mean that such individuals wanted to trample over others as a sign of their greatness. Rather, as he put in On the Genealogy of Morals, the great ‚Äúeagle‚Äù devotes very little thought one way or another to the ‚Äúlambs‚Äù beneath it. But that includes feelings of pity where the lamb lies between the eagle and its goals.\n",
    "There is nothing very odd about lambs disliking birds of prey, but this is no reason for holding it against large birds of prey that they carry off lambs. And when the lambs whisper among themselves, ‚ÄòThese birds of prey are evil, and does this not give us a right to say that whatever of the opposite of a bird of prey must be good?‚Äô there is nothing intrinsically wrong with such an argument‚Äîthough the birds of prey will look somewhat quizzically and say, ‚ÄòWe have nothing against these good lambs; in fact, we love them; nothing tastes better than a tender lamb.‚Äô\n",
    "\n",
    "Thirdly, Nietzsche would hardly be a friend of the contemporary Right either, in any of its various forms. Despite some rejigging by figures like Ayn Rand, Nietzsche was hardly a proto-libertarian or classical liberal. Nietzsche disdained consumer culture and capitalism, seeing it as producing vulgar and decadent societies of ‚Äúlast men‚Äù focused on the pursuit of meaningless wealth and menial satisfactions. These last men lived out their days in material affluence, but were committed to no truly great projects, mostly concerned with issues like ‚Äúhealth‚Äù and physical appearance. One can think of the Wall Street icons ridiculed by Bret Easton Ellis in American Psycho, each thinking he was lord of the world and each in fact tedious and indistinguishable from on another. Nietzsche was also dismissive of nationalism, sharing Schopenhauer‚Äôs opinion that it was an infantile outlook for individuals not strong enough to will their own destiny without banding together with the rest of the ‚Äúherd.‚Äù Part of this is due to Nietzsche‚Äôs personal disdain for German nationalism, and his preference for pan-Europeanism. Whether this means he would be fond of the contemporary European Union, with its liberal outlook and social democratic policies, one can only guess. But he would have certainly regarded the idea of moving away from the nation-state model appealing.¬†\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, Nietzsche would have found the invocations by the far Right‚Äîpast and present‚Äîinfuriating. He often looked at his sister Elizabeth‚Äôs gradual descent into German nationalism and later Nazism with an uncharacteristic mixture of pity and scorn. Had Nietzsche lived to see the rise of Hitler, he would likely have immediately recognized the Austrian dropout as the mean and resentful creature he was. He would likely have been horrified to see his work on the will to power and the great man transformed into a kind of racist eugenics, insisting that his work was about the individual self and not collective genetic overcoming. And, of course, Nietzsche would regard the deindividuation of totalitarianism, its attempt to completely assimilate the single person into the nation, as nihilistic. Today, no doubt Nietzsche would have lambasted the alt-right efforts to associate his work with concerns about immigration and the racial makeup of society.\n",

    "Conclusion: What Can We Learn From Nietzsche\n",
    "Nietzsche is one of the most difficult thinkers in the Western canon to think through. This is both in spite and because of his brilliant literary powers. In part due to illness which hampered his ability to write for an extended period of time, most of Nietzsche‚Äôs writings appear as aphorisms and short essays rather than sustained works. Nietzsche was also moody and emotional, meaning that he occasionally lashes out with vitriol against a figure or idea which is later treated more soberly. Overall, his philosophy is not a manual for how to become a Nietzschian, but rather how to overcome one‚Äôs self limitations and unleash new creative potential and insight. Nonetheless, there are two key points we can pick up from his work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, Nietzsche draws our attention to the historical contingency of many of our moral conceits. This is perhaps best accomplished in the On the Genealogy of Morals and the short books Twilight of the Idols and The Antichrist. In these works, Nietzsche develops some of his most striking imagery and ideas. He suggests that most every moral philosopher and figure thus far has failed to recognize that the moral claims they presented were historically and psychologically motivated. They took the moral claims presented as true, when in fact they were culturally or psychologically motivated. The failure to acknowledge this left us unable to recognize the deepest prompts to our actions, leading to a great deal of corruption and vulgarization.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, Nietzsche famously had mixed feelings about Jesus Christ, occasionally ridiculing him, and occasionally praising him as the only opponent worthy of the Antichrist. In either case, he was the only real Christian and he ‚Äúdied on the cross.‚Äù Later Christians appropriated his rhetoric to argue that he sought to bring universal love. The reality is that they wanted to replace the aristocratic and warlike ancient Greco-Roman world with one that conformed to the mediocrity of the slaves, and so needed to find a way to re-describe weakness and servility as a moral virtue. The upshot was Christian morality, which was resentful to its core. Nietzsche often gleefully pointed out how the religion of universal love was paranoid about sin, fixating with almost erotic satisfaction on the suffering of those in hell. Nietzsche thought that unawareness of often unconscious motivators leads us to make vulgar and baseless moral claims. This insight is frequently misused today by a host of commentators who substitute pop-psychologism for real analysis of their opponent‚Äôs position. Invocations of resentment can also be dangerously overused to dismiss appeals which are really about fairness or justice. Nonetheless, it was a profound contribution to our understanding of morality.\n",
    "Secondly, and most innovatively, Nietzsche‚Äôs writings radically deepened our understanding of what constitutes authentic individuality. Like his existentialist kin S√∏ren Kierkegaard and Simone de Beauvoir, Nietzsche recognized that we all too often regard being an individual as simply doing what we profess to want. It certainly is not mere consumerism and the acquisition of material goods. He draws our attention to the many ways in which external factors like culture and internal psychological motivations like resentment can actually lead us to become false or vulgar iterations of our selves. The task then is to free ourselves from these inauthentic constraints through continuous and arduous self-overcoming.\n",
    "\n",
    "I don‚Äôt think Nietzsche was concerned with ‚Äòauthenticity‚Äô in the Maslowian sense (which is where you seem headed in the last paragraph; I don‚Äôt know Kierkegaard well enough definitively to add his name here, too.) Don‚Äôt forget that Nietzsche believed in the ubiquity of the will to power ‚Äî he says in ‚ÄòThe Will To Power‚Äô that the WTP is what we are ‚Äî and therefore also believed in the inevitability ‚Äì and value ‚Äì of great social hierarchies. (And of our fundamental needs to obey ‚Äî and command.) Any Nietzschean project of ‚Äòbecoming who one is‚Äô must therefore reconcile itself with such elemental facts of ‚Äònature‚Äô and human nature. This is something well beyond ‚Äòself-overcoming‚Äô of (presumably socialized) ‚Äòinauthentic constraints‚Äô: it means transcending many constraints we‚Äôve also come to identify as human; becoming (as N says in ‚ÄòBeyond Good and Evil‚Äô) at once ‚Äòmore G-d and more beast‚Äô.Also, you make no mention of N‚Äôs epistemology ‚Äî which is a useful part of his moral critique and not at all separate from it. Because we misperceive the world ‚Äì via anthropological and linguistic errors ‚Äì we also fail to see its essence ‚Äî the sovereignty of the will to power. (We mistakenly believe in ‚Äòthings‚Äô, cause and effect, etc. ‚Äì the whole mechanistic universe.) This erroneous ‚Äòdependable and logical‚Äô world we‚Äôve constructed for ourselves is also not ‚Äònoble‚Äô in N‚Äôs view: ‚Äòreason,‚Äô science and the deification of Truth are for him already moralistic corruptions of the spirit; and they have accordingly only added to the original perceptual/phenomenological errors of our forefathers. (Quantum physics, or at least so I glean, also seems to be leaning to a conception of the world not composed of matter but of loci of information; or perhaps as N would say, of ‚Äòcenters of force‚Äô.) For Nietzsche, any ‚Äòoptimum individual‚Äô (we used to call him the Superman) must needs grasp all this, too, and see the world in a wholly new way: as composed of the will to power and nothing more.Though perhaps no one can yet experience such a world-view, Nietzsche‚Äôs argument does draw back the veil and raise our consciousness almost to the point.\n",

The corresponding strategy for economics is obvious: to secure new kinds of data at the micro level, data that will provide direct evidence about the behavior of economic agents and the ways in which they go about making their decisions (support fo this thesis comes from surprising directions.

That is why being the first black female history professor does not mean anything to me if I'm not given and can't find means to bring others up.\"[5] Otele also highlighted the difficulties she encountered in becoming a Professor: \"I've worked very hard and kept pushing and had a family...It's hard. I'm tired. It's bleak.\"[18] The Vice-Chancellor of Bath Spa University, Professor Susan Rigby described Otele as \"world-class and internationally respected\".[19] Otele announced her promotion from her active Twitter account.[20]\n",

The book, which took Peterson 13 years to complete, describes a comprehensive theory about how people construct meaning, form beliefs and make narratives using ideas from various fields including mythology, religion, literature, philosophy and psychology in accordance to the modern scientific understanding of how the brain functions.[31][5][43]\n",
    "According to Peterson, his main goal was to examine why both individuals and groups participate in social conflict, explore the reasoning and motivation individuals take to support their belief systems (i.e. ideological identification[31]) that eventually results in killing and pathological atrocities like the Gulag, the Auschwitz concentration camp and the Rwandan genocide.[31][5][43] He considers that an \"analysis of the world's religious ideas might allow us to describe our essential morality and eventually develop a universal system of morality\".[43] Jungian archetypes play an important role in the book.[4]\n",

A doctrine's power of conviction increases with the square of the number of men participating in it‚Äîthe relationship is geometric. As soon as a doctrine has a sufficient number of adherents, the nonconformist becomes a heretic who must be liquidated.  \n",

    "There are two kinds of people in the world; those who try to fit our chaotic existence into a semblance of order, and those who believe that the best one can do is surf the waves of chaos as reality hurls them at you. The latter group has much to thank Nassim Nicholas Taleb for. Taleb's famous book, The Black Swan, describes the power of unforeseeable events, and the damage they can wreak on unsuspecting societies. This Lebanese-American writer and statistician thinks of himself as an epistemologist of randomness as opposed to a businessman. His work on probability examines the limitations of knowledge, and likewise proves the importance of anticipating seemingly impossible scenarios.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This extremely skeptical starting point has led Taleb to oppose large scale social theorizing. He has gone so far as to say that the Nobel Prize in economics should be done away with, for the damage that economic metanarratives does is immense. Instead, he advances what he calls \"robustification\" and \"anti-fragility.\" Not surprisingly, his Ph.D. dissertation focused on the mathematics of derivatives pricing, which is arguably the most unstable part of the market. Regardless of whether you think Taleb goes too far in his sweeping rebuttal of most economic theorizing, at the very least this very bright man's words are a much needed call for sobriety in a market otherwise known for excess.  \n",

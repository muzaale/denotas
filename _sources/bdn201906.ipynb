The national brewers‚Äô association declares Germany ‚ÄúEuropean Champion‚Äù. It brewed 94.4m hectolitres last year, beaten only by China, America and Brazil.  \n",

    "But the truth is that Germans are going off their ale. At unification in 1990, annual consumption averaged 148 litres per head; last year it was just 107 litres. Instead, they are turning to wine, which has a higher status. Connoisseurs think there is another reason for falling sales: that so many German beers are bland and indistinguishable. The country has many tiny breweries whose ales can only be had locally. Some, like the smoked beers of Bamberg in Franconia, are distinctive.   \n",

    "Thereafter, it was open warfare. Nietzsche passed up no chance to mock Wagner's sentimental return to the Christian faith, and Cosima tried to pretend that Nietzsche was dead. Nietzsche was the weaker party, ever more sick in mind and body, and unable to avoid hoping that Cosima would rescue him by turning against her husband and his memory. It was useless. As the Wagner cult became more intense after the Master's death, Cosima found her role as its high priestess. Nietzsche was at best an inconvenience, at worst a threat. Ariadne would neither deliver Theseus from the Minotaur nor accept this second Dionysus alongside her departed Dionysian lover. Intolerable as Cosima was, it is hard to see what she could in fact have done for Nietzsche; still, one flinches at the last words of this book: to his guardians at the German asylum, Nietzsche declared, ''It was my wife Cosima Wagner who brought me here.''  \n",

    "Freud's difficulty in appreciating music, even though he seems to have been one of Charcot's 'auditifs' and had given auditory imagery a central place in his psychology, is re-examined in the light of his dealings with various distinguished musicians, and with special reference to the musical career of 'Little Hans'. The author argues that Freud's exaggeration of his difficulty, combined with his ability to enjoy certain operas and his use of musical metaphors in the context of theory and therapy, confirms his own intuition of a conflict rather than a simple deficiency. This conflict is examined with reference to the theories of Eissler and of Vitz, and in the light of his own interest in classical Greek culture and in the nature of Art. Since opera was perhaps the only form of music that Freud could readily enjoy, the relation between words and melody in that genre is addressed. The significance for Freud of the specific works and passages that he mentions throughout his writings is examined in the light of some of his own theoretical concepts: (a) with special reference to 'oedipal' features, to the dynamics of 'eros' and 'thanatos', and to the balance between the 'primary' and 'secondary' processes in artistic creativity; and (b) as exemplified in his favourite operas 'The Marriage of Figaro', 'Don Giovanni', 'Carmen' and 'The Mastersingers'. The parts played, in his problem with music, by his envy of the artist's intuitive talent for seduction and by his own 'acoustic atrophy' are also considered. He is defended against the recent charge that, in order to avoid having to cede primacy to others on points of psychology, he deliberately misrepresented how much he knew about music.  \n",

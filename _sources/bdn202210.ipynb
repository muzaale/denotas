    "Finally, being a wholesome Christian who is educated and yet is established in Godly family values, the outcome is the creation of an environment of respect for God, for His Word and for authority. It will lay foundations of discipline, moral values and a work ethic that will prepare a student for life. That student will grow into such a pullar in society because He is well anchored in God's Word with education and solid family values.\n",

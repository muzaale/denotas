    "— Second, curious creatures called scientists document the impact of those external realities on their senses and attempt to reproduce this experience beyond their anecdotal experience (ie the trials are repeated across several observers) and statistical summary of the observations with a mean and variance is documented \n",
    "— Finally, the findings are submitted for peer-review to weed out abstract concepts, clarify errors in logic, and ensure reproducibility of findings \n",

    "\n",
    "With almost 141million followers on TikTok and just over 78 million more on Instagram, Khaby Lame is one of the most followed social media stars in the world. And how has the 22-year-old Italian achieved this? Chiefly through silently satirizing the ridiculous content that other people post in order to become more followed on social media. Now that really is meta.\n",
    "\n",
    "“The funniest part of my content is the silence,” said Lame over WhatsApp yesterday: “Silent comedy speaks a language that everybody in the world can understand.” By doing in the digital age what Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, and Buster Keaton once did during the dawn of cinema, Lame has gone from unemployed factory worker (he started posting after being laid off at the start of the pandemic) to a man who rubs shoulders with global icons like Leo Messi: “Meeting him is one thing I still can’t believe happened.”\n",
    "\n",
    "From 6 pm tonight in San Babila, Milan, Lame will launch his first-ever capsule collection with Boss before throwing a party later at the city’s most famous nightspot, Plastic, so his locally based fans will have the chance to see him IRL. “There will be a giant Khaby,” said Lame. “We will take Polaroid pictures. I will arrive on a scooter flanked by a team of BMX riders wearing the collection. It’ll be amazing!” Doubtless many more will check in via their screens too. Lame says that around 15% of his audience is from Italy, 25 % is from South America, and 30% is from the US*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Boss x Khaby collection is a tight ensemble including varsity jacket and hoodie. One surprising inclusion—and the reason for that ‘giant Khaby’ promised at the reveal later—is a Khaby doll designed to be used as an accessory or an attachment that can be snapped onto the garments. Huh? Lame explained: “When I was a kid I had an action figure of Vegeta from Dragon Ball and I’ve been collecting action figures for years. I’m really passionate about action figures and anime characters. And now to see that there is a doll of myself and there will be an event to launch it along with the collection… I’m super excited.” Lame's capsule will be on sale exclusively in Boss’s San Babila store today before going on global release tomorrow.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as pumping out content with his team every day, and thinking through his next capsule—“I definitely want to do another one”—Lame is also focused on learning English and plotting his future moves. He said: “I want to be an actor, like Will Smith. He started with comedy, then he made more dramatic movies. He’s done all sorts of films, he’s a great actor and I would like to be like him. In fact my passion for acting started with him, watching him in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Watching that show, I realized that I also wanted to make people laugh.” Lame is certainly doing that on social. And with that 200 million-plus audience already behind him it seems a no-brainer that we’ll see him on bigger screens soon enough.\n",

    "   “Once the Romans are conquered we shall have all the riches of Italy at our disposal,” Pyrrhus answered.\n",

    "   \"What will we do after that?”\n",
    "   \"We will secure all of the Greek world under my rule,” the king nodded at the thought.\n",

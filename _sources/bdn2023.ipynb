    "To compete with contemporary popular musicians such as the Beatles and Bob Dylan, Campus Crusade sponsored its own Christian popular music band called the New Folk. According to historian John G. Turner, Campus Crusade under Bright's leadership also actively sought to confront the counterculture movement during the 1960s and 1970s. One notable Campus Crusade campaign was the \"Berkeley Blitz\" in January 1967 which saw 600 Campus Crusade staff and students organize a series of events including concerts, dinners for international students, a performance by the illusionist Andr√© Kole, and a sermon by evangelist Billy Graham. Campus Crusade also claimed to have converted 700 students and faculty members  \n",
    "\n",
    "In 1972, Campus Crusade in coordination with the Jesus Movement organized a week-long International Student Congress on Evangelism at Cotton Bowl Stadium in Dallas known as Explo '72. The Explo '72 conference featured evangelism and discipleship training and contemporary music events. It was attended by 80,000 college and high school students and was nicknamed as the \"Christian Woodstock\" in the media. Besides Billy Graham, the event featured several contemporary popular musicians including Johnny Cash, Kris Kristofferson, the Christian band Love Song, \\textcolor{blue}{Andra√© Crouch}, and the Disciples  \n",
    "\n",
    "During the 1980s, Campus Crusade increased its cooperation with the charismatic, Pentecostal, and Catholic churches and denominations. Bright's personal friendships with charismatic and Pentecostal Christians and Zachary Bright's charismatic experience led Campus Crusade to soften its stance towards charismatic and Pentecostal churches. In 1983, Campus Crusade overturned its ban on staff members speaking in tongues. During the late 1980s, Campus Crusade also partnered with the Assemblies of God in missionary work in [Africa](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1986-01-04-me-24254-story.html) and Latin America. In addition, Campus Crusade also collaborated with the Catholic Church to distribute the Jesus film in Catholic countries   \n",

    "\n",
    "Last week, Bernie Madoff, (pronounced ‚Äúmade off‚Äù as in ‚Äúmade off with all your money‚Äù) died in prison. He was serving a 150-year term for defrauding thousands of people of as much as $65 billion dollars. He was a young 82 and had served only 12 years of the 150-year sentence. No word yet on who will cover the other 138 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among his famous clueless victims were the brilliant director and filmmaker Steven Spielberg, the brilliant actor Kevin Bacon and the brilliant Hall of Fame pitcher Sandy Koufax. Which in retrospect doesn‚Äôt make them look so brilliant after all.\n",
    "One actually brilliant man, independent investigator Harry Markopolos, smelled a rat as early as 2000, but was unable to convince anyone that Madoff was a fake, because nobody could hear him over the loud party music investors were playing as they were celebrating their improbable returns on their investments.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might ask how he was able to hoodwink so many people for so long. That‚Äôs easy. He simply used a version of the well-known pyramid scheme, which was invented in Egypt. That‚Äôs where the top man, Madoff in this case, proposes to build a pyramid made out of other people‚Äôs money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Madoff, acting as the pharaoh, convinces all the gullible people he can to fork over their hard earned cash in return for a piece of the pie, I mean, ‚Äúpyramid‚Äù.\n",
    "\n",
    "The more people foolishly hand over their money, the more the pharaoh tells them how brilliant they are to be investing in his pyramid. This only makes the people want to question him less and fork over even more money.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because pyramid schemes (being made of money, not mortar and bricks) are naturally flawed, his pyramid eventually collapsed to the ultimate horror of the investors and building inspectors but mostly to the horror of the Securities and Exchange Commission or SEC. \n",
    "That‚Äôs the highly financed, watchdog government agency designed to protect us hard-working taxpayers from people like Mr. Madoff, but which was obviously asleep at the wheel.\n",
    "So how silly does that make the SEC look? I think the SEC ranks just above FEMA in terms of likeability of government agencies designed to help us. That‚Äôs how.\n",
    "\n",
    "What Madoff was doing was closer to what‚Äôs called a Ponzi scheme. It convinces people to invest their money blindly and can maintain the illusion of a sustainable investment vehicle as long as new people contribute new funds, and as long as those investing do not ask full repayment and still believe in the non-existent assets they supposedly are entitled to. This incidentally sounds just like our Social Security system. Just giving you fair warning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the meantime, just be wary of any investors with get-rich-quick schemes involving three-dimensional objects like pyramids, cubes, cones or arches. Always ask to see the building permit first.\n",

    "'Jacob' means 'supplanter'=One who wrongfully or illegally seizes and holds the place of another i.e. usurper). In the bible, Jacob did some things:\n",
    "(i) he deceitfully made Esau to sell his birthright; and\n",
    "(ii) took Esau's blessing by false pretense.\n",
    "Of course, Jacob didn't need to do all these to prosper. But his mum encouraged and supported him.\n",
    "(i) and (ii) portray him in the light of today's internet fraudsters commonly called 'Yahoo boys'. By deceitfully taking someone's birthright through exchange with food is similar to 'advance fee fraud' which many tag '419' in Nigeria. Furthermore, birthright being exclusive to an individual is like a password or bank account details. By pretending to be Esau in dressing and speech, Jacob deceived his father. This is a 'yahoo boy' way of operation.\n",
    "He ended up suffering for all he did. He even met a senior 'Yahoo boy' in the person of Laban who:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) changed his salary 10 times;\n",
    "(b) deceived him maritally to serve for another 7 years after serving for an initial 7 years (making 14 years and was not still willing to release him);\n",
    "(c) who was part of the reason why Jacob lost his preferred wife Rachel at an early age.\n",
    "(e) He lived in the fear of Esau;\n",
    "(f) Was deceived by his children that Joseph had died;\n",
    "(g) He went through that trauma for years.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was why God had to change his name from Jacob to Israel. One can use these to minister to Yahoo boys that they should repent or await future punishments and consequences.\n",
    "In fact, Jacob himself at old age confessed to Pharoah of his struggles through evil times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gen 47:8 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?\n",
    "\n",
    "Gen 47:9 And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and EVIL HAVE THE DAYS OF THE YEARS OF MY LIFE BEEN, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at Jacob in the light of the above, we can use him to preach repentance to yahoo boys. But this must be well explained and analyzed.\n",

    "Moreover, action requires an inhibition of consciousness‚Äîit requires turning away from other possibilities and, in the moment of decision, blocking off all those mental motions that work against action, such as futility and ambivalence. The will to act, therefore, is a sign not that a man is full of force but that he is empty of human richness. ‚ÄúThe exaltation of the will, in Iago,‚Äù Bloom writes, ‚Äúemanates from an ontological lack so great that no human emotion possibly could fill it.‚Äù Action, decision, will‚Äîall are limited. Bloom‚Äôs hero is Hamlet, whom he compares to Nietzsche‚Äôs Dionysian man. ‚ÄúBoth have once looked truly into the essence of things,‚Äù he writes. ‚ÄúThey have gained knowledge, and nausea inhibits action; for their action could not change anything in the eternal nature of things.¬†.¬†.¬†.

    "Hamlet and Macbeth both portray usurpers as ruling kings, and in each case it is made clear that such rule is not to be tolerated either by the ruled or by the universe. Indeed, the fate of kings is tied to the order of the universe, and dissension and tension in one is reflected in the other. Yet, the issue is complex, and while the usurper has no right to rule, it is not always clear who has the right to prevent him from ruling. In Macbeth, the fate of the usurper is ordained, and his downfall at the hands of the wronged Macduff, who is the rightful king. Macduff has the right to retake his throne by force. The hesitation of Hamlet, much commented on by critics, may derive from the fact that while he knows Claudio to be a regicide, to kill Claudio would make him a regicide as well. In both plays, the usurpation of the throne leads to a more dangerous and uncertain environment in the land, and nature concurs by expressing through storms and other travails visited upon the people that a great political wrong is also a great moral and religious wrong\n",

    "Have you ever read the Theogony? It‚Äôs a fairly short book, although a fascinating account of the Greek gods. The Iliad and The Odyssey are epic works. So that‚Äôs for starters. I would argue that the Iliad and the Odyssey are also just more interesting, being histories that had it all: war, murder, rape, betrayal, adultery, gods, witches, magic, victory, defeat, misfortune, revenge, vindication‚Äîyou name it, it‚Äôs in the Iliad or the Odyssey. Each of them could make a fine mini-series!\n",

    "I‚Äôm joking, of course. To an extent. But the Theogony isn‚Äôt as famous as the Homeric epics for a number of reasons!\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, it isn‚Äôt a coherent narrative in the same way as Homer‚Äôs works are. It‚Äôs really more of an epic catalogue (which, as we‚Äôll know from the catalogue of ships in Iliad 2, are everyone‚Äôs favourite parts of an ancient text‚Ä¶ not).\n",
    "\n",
    "It‚Äôs also significant that the Homeric epics document a very popular set of stories ‚Äî the Epic Cycle was epic indeed! Battles at Troy? Enduring heroes struggling to get home? Mythical monsters? Everyone wants to hear about those! Can we really pretend that a blunt list of the 50+ children of ‚ÄòNereus and rich-haired Doris‚Äô is as gripping as Achilles telling Hektor he‚Äôd like to hack him up and eat his flesh raw?\n",
    "\n",
    "It hasn‚Äôt been studied in the school system (ancient to modern) like the Homeric epics have been; that‚Äôs one of the main reasons for the tenacity of Homer‚Äôs works ‚Äî they‚Äôve been very popular for a long time! The Theogony just hasn‚Äôt been treated with quite so much affection, over the years‚Ä¶ it isn‚Äôt as easy to read, nor necessarily as much of a pleasure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Theogony also just isn‚Äôt quite as impressive as the Homeric epics. It‚Äôs only about 1000 lines, compared to the Odyssey‚Äôs ~12,000, or the Iliad‚Äôs ~15,000.\n",

The vast majority of shows fit people into something of a mold, and usually into a binary set of categories— hero vs. villain, smart vs. stupid, calculated vs. impulsive. The Wire doesn’t do that. Every significant character is multi-layered and complex. Their flaws and their virtues are gradually revealed through their actions rather than expressed in simple terms. Characters who are tragically flawed in some ways are prodigious in others. And the show does a phenomenal job of showing how most of those characters became who they were. That makes it maybe the most impressive TV series ever created.  \n",

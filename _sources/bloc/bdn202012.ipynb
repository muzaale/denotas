When a man was afflicted with swelling in the stomach and the limbs he was not allowed to die in the house. He was carried to the Evil Forest and left there to die. There was the story of a very stubborn man who staggered back to his house and had to be carried again to the forest and tied to a tree. The sickness was an abomination to the earth, and so the victim could not be buried in her bowels. He died and rotted away above the earth, and was not given the first or the second burial.

    "‚ÄúNothing is beautiful, except man alone: all aesthetics rests upon this na√Øvet√©, which is its first truth. Let us immediately add the second: nothing is ugly except the degenerating man ‚Äî and with this the realm of aesthetic judgment is circumscribed. Physiologically, everything ugly weakens and saddens man. It reminds him of decay, danger, impotence; it actually deprives him of strength. One can measure the effect of the ugly with a dynamometer. Wherever man is depressed at all, he senses the proximity of something ‚Äúugly.‚Äù His feeling of power, his will to power, his courage, his pride ‚Äî all fall with the ugly and rise with the beautiful. In both cases we draw an inference: the premises for it are piled up in the greatest abundance in instinct. The ugly is understood as a sign and symptom of degeneration: whatever reminds us in the least of degeneration causes in us the judgment of ‚Äúugly.‚Äù Every suggestion of exhaustion, of heaviness, of age, of weariness; every kind of lack of freedom, such as cramps, such as paralysis; and above all, the smell, the color, the form of dissolution, of decomposition ‚Äî even in the ultimate attenuation into a symbol ‚Äî all evoke the same[‚Ä¶]‚Äù  \n",

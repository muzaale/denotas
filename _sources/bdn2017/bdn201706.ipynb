    "I‚Äôve read the entire Vanity Affair article. Unbearably and inexcusably long! To summarize, Comey is a moralist ‚Äî and that is his greatest strength and weakness? I guess I agree with this conclusion. But surely this article could have reached that conclusion in about 3 sentences and added some flesh to it in 4 additional paragraphs. Glad I read it anyway and thanks for recommending it.    \n",
    "\n",
    "So the NYC FBI seems to be a wild-card toting division that DC-central just can‚Äôt stand or trust. And although Comey had managed to side-step the NYC division for this reason (Clintons emails leaks were really in their jurisdiction), the cantankerous division was able to reassert its ‚Äúusefulness‚Äù to the Cinton case through a fortuitous discovery while investigating Anthony Weiner. Intriguing!    \n",
    "\n",
    "Now it doesn‚Äôt even look like a fortuitous discovery at all. The NYC bureau was most definitely after Weiner because he had shown himself, repeatedly, and very reliably, over a 3 year period, to be the only weakness apparent in Huma Abadeen/Hillary Clinton‚Äôs chain of strength and resilience. And Rudi Guliano might have played a role in this ‚Äî with his connections as former prosecutor and Mayor ‚Äî and might have wielded this wild-card in seducing Trump (because he had something powerful to offer him).   \n",

    "I saw it somehow at the very first blush as romantic‚Äîfor the use, of course I mean, I should certainly have had to make of it‚Äîthat Jane Clairmont, the half-sister of Mary Godwin, Shelley‚Äôs second wife and for a while the intimate friend of Byron and the mother of his daughter Allegra, should have been living on in Florence, where she had long lived, up to our own day, and that in fact, had I happened to hear of her but a little sooner, I might have seen her in the flesh. The question of whether I should have wished to do so was another matter‚Äîthe question of whether I shouldn‚Äôt have preferred to keep her preciously unseen, to run no risk, in other words, by too rude a choice, of depreciating that romance-value which, as I say, it was instantly inevitably to attach (through association above all, with another signal circumstance) to her long survival  \n",

A film that could help to bury forever all those dead things we carry within ourselves. Instead, I’m the one without the courage to bury anything at all. And now I’m utterly confused. This launch pad to deal with… I wonder why things turned out this way. When did I go wrong? I really have nothing to say, but I want to say it all the same.\n",

    "'Jacob' means 'supplanter'=One who wrongfully or illegally seizes and holds the place of another i.e. usurper). In the bible, Jacob did some things:\n",
    "(i) he deceitfully made Esau to sell his birthright; and\n",
    "(ii) took Esau's blessing by false pretense.\n",
    "Of course, Jacob didn't need to do all these to prosper. But his mum encouraged and supported him.\n",
    "(i) and (ii) portray him in the light of today's internet fraudsters commonly called 'Yahoo boys'. By deceitfully taking someone's birthright through exchange with food is similar to 'advance fee fraud' which many tag '419' in Nigeria. Furthermore, birthright being exclusive to an individual is like a password or bank account details. By pretending to be Esau in dressing and speech, Jacob deceived his father. This is a 'yahoo boy' way of operation.\n",
    "He ended up suffering for all he did. He even met a senior 'Yahoo boy' in the person of Laban who:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) changed his salary 10 times;\n",
    "(b) deceived him maritally to serve for another 7 years after serving for an initial 7 years (making 14 years and was not still willing to release him);\n",
    "(c) who was part of the reason why Jacob lost his preferred wife Rachel at an early age.\n",
    "(e) He lived in the fear of Esau;\n",
    "(f) Was deceived by his children that Joseph had died;\n",
    "(g) He went through that trauma for years.\n",
    "\n",
    "This was why God had to change his name from Jacob to Israel. One can use these to minister to Yahoo boys that they should repent or await future punishments and consequences.\n",
    "In fact, Jacob himself at old age confessed to Pharoah of his struggles through evil times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gen 47:8 And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?\n",
    "\n",
    "Gen 47:9 And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and EVIL HAVE THE DAYS OF THE YEARS OF MY LIFE BEEN, and have not attained unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at Jacob in the light of the above, we can use him to preach repentance to yahoo boys. But this must be well explained and analyzed.\n",

    "Moreover, action requires an inhibition of consciousness—it requires turning away from other possibilities and, in the moment of decision, blocking off all those mental motions that work against action, such as futility and ambivalence. The will to act, therefore, is a sign not that a man is full of force but that he is empty of human richness. “The exaltation of the will, in Iago,” Bloom writes, “emanates from an ontological lack so great that no human emotion possibly could fill it.” Action, decision, will—all are limited. Bloom’s hero is Hamlet, whom he compares to Nietzsche’s Dionysian man. “Both have once looked truly into the essence of things,” he writes. “They have gained knowledge, and nausea inhibits action; for their action could not change anything in the eternal nature of things. . . . Knowledge kills action; action requires the veils of illusion: that is the doctrine of Hamlet.”   \n",

The arrow that is to fly far must be discharged from a well distended bow: if, therefore, anything is necessary for greatness, it is a fierce and tenacious opposition, an opposition either of open contempt, or of malicious irony, or of sly silence, or of gross stupidity, an opposition regardless of the wounds it inflicts and of the precious lives it sacrifices, an opposition that nobody would dare to attack who was not prepared, like the Spartan of old, to return either with his shield or on it.  \n",

    "Here's the article from two weeks ago --pretty decent by any standards --which however Kalyegera believes was poorly written. Like many in Africa's middle-class, Kalyegera feels patronized by the western medias portrayal of African nations as being on some humiliating audition for membership at the big boys table. Indeed, any African who feels that they're already at this table may feel slighted -- but that's besides the point because individual pride doesn't speak for an entire nation or continent populated by poor folk.   \n",
    "\n",
    "According to imperfect but somewhat reasonable benchmarks, the % of Africans with income > $10 a day (i.e., middle class) is smaller than the equivalent in other parts of the world. For a continent that mostly imports goods, and in dollars, there's hardly any need to adjust this income for purchasing power parity. Many middle class folks have their costs denominated in dollars (imported cars, household items, air travel, etc). But Kalyegera disagrees and so he compares rent for an apartment in Geneva to one in Jinja, and thinks a $200 income in Jinja is comparable to a $3000 income in Geneva. It's like comparing an American with an iPhone 6 to a Ugandan with a Nokia 5110 (both make calls and receive SMS, Kalyegera might say).    \n",
    "  \n",
    "But to truly expose Kalyegera for his more visceral than intellectual response to the Economists article, I'll quote from it to show how reasonable it was: A few years ago, Shoprite Holdings, South Africa’s largest retailer, envisaged opening 600-800 stores in Nigeria. It currently has 12. Across the continent in Kenya, Cadbury and Coca-Cola have closed factories. “We thought this would be the next Asia”, Nestlé’s chief executive for equatorial Africa said earlier this year. “But we have realised the middle class…is extremely small and it is not really growing.” See? The article is not all about a Ghanaian anecdote. And it founded on fundamentals. Anyways, please read it in it's entirely if you have the time. And then reread Kalyegera. He'll be exposed. (He's inferiority complex is evident when he says \"he could have written something better. Why not? Who said he couldn't???)   \n",

    "I've just watched the Mallence Bart-Williams TEDtalk: a beautiful story, by a beautiful presenter, of a beautiful nation. However, it reminds me of the story of Jacob and Esau -- the only Biblical story that baffled me as a child.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Why was Jacob rewarded greatly for exploiting his twin brother Esau? We can ask the same of European colonialists of past and present: why have they been rewarded enormously (longer life expectancy, greater quality of life, greater wealth, greater military power, greater interest in harnessing nature for science and technology, etc) for stealing the inheritance of their African brethren?   \n",
    "\n",
    "A question not to ask: would Africans even care as much for their inheritance (diamonds and gold, for instance) if it weren't for how much Europeans fuss about it? A question to ask, did Esau not care as much for his inheritance as Jacob did? Should Africa just keep complaining about being exploited or should it take a stand and fight -- Like the biblical Gideon did -- for its rights and promised land?  \n",

    ".  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "My thoughts are that the key to being a great communicator is to understand your audience. Mallence clearly appeals to emotional-type audiences (the most common ones). But the problem with emotion is that it has a brief half-life and so people can't follow through to action based on those roused emotions. They'll be distracted by the next emotional upheaval.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Some other audiences actually find it unappealing when a speaker tries to approach a subject using emotion. This type of audience resists any appeals to their baser nature   \n",
    "\n",
    ".  \n",
    "\n",
    "When a speaker rouses people's emotions, the goal may be to set them into motion and rouse action and change. But history shows that it's only those who rouse themselves into an emotional frenzy -- with no external help -- who follow through with action and change (Museveni did so after losing the 1980 elections).   \n",
    "\n",
    "So, whereas it's nice to bring audiences to tears (guarantees that you'll be invited by other folks who also need inspiration & wish to shed a tear or two), not sure such tears lead to any tangible changes in society.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It's the true tears of experience in those with a WILL TO POWER that bring change. But most people are too timid to will such power, because of the clear risks involved. They'd rather complain about their misery -- or sing about their blues -- rather than offend their oppressors.  \n",
    "\n",
    ".  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, we seem to be on the same page regarding persuasive communication -- which some call rhetoric.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, emotional appeals are a central component to rhetoric (Greeks call it Pathos). But two more components of rhetoric must be mentioned, namely: the appeal to reason (Logos) and the appeal to moral character of the speaker (Ethos). The last one is crucial, and Mallence scored highly on this one: the somber mood with which she presented her talk (one would think she'd missed breakfast), her inky cloak of solemn black (black clothes), and a sort of resignation in her voice (as a daughter of an exploited country). We shall sooner trust her than a different speaker who hasn't truly experienced the things they are talking about.   \n",
    "\n",
    "So more than appealing to emotion, a speaker should also appeal to reason, and the audiences sense of trust -- that the speaker isn't fraudulent.   \n",

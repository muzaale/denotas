    "1.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† I didn‚Äôt see any email that you sent RMS telling them that you do intend to submit the application this cycle, but that it will come a bit later than their initial deadlines\n",
    "2.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† The intro letter has several grammar errors and incomplete sentences. It is truly offensive to have even one error like this in a grant, let alone an intro letter, and is concerning for me because it seems that you were fully intending to submit this intro letter with your resubmission.\n",
    "3.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† You got a 20, so I would make your paragraph of ‚Äúthe good things that were said‚Äù about twice as long. I am attaching the intro letter that I submitted with my K24 resubmission to give you some text about the score ‚Äì I would definitely mention the current payline of 18 so that the reviewers know they have to give you 1‚Äôs. I would not use first-person like I did ‚Äì I did that because a K24 is more of a ‚Äútalking to your colleagues‚Äù application than a ‚Äúbegging more senior people for starter money‚Äù kind like a K08\n",
    "4.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† They told you that your career development plan was slightly overambitious but they actually liked it. In response, you all but eviscerated it. I wouldn‚Äôt do that. I would cut ONE course max, and say that you cut the course least related to the proposed science. Talking about the overlap between training and research is fine and a good idea.\n",
    "5.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† Implying that you‚Äôre looking at sex as a biological variable because it‚Äôs part of the new NIH policy is almost like you‚Äôre telling the reviewers that THEY‚Äôre comments about this were unimportant to you, and that the science is unimportant to you, but you‚Äôre just doing it because the NIH requires it. I would take that stuff out, and instead say indeed these are interesting questions and we‚Äôve proposed the following science. Also, you need to propose something much more interesting than ‚Äúdifferential magnitude of risk in men vs women‚Äù which seems banal ‚Äì at least propose some interactions or something\n",
    "6.¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬† You CANNOT blow off their request for a power calculation. Just do something. Doesn‚Äôt matter what. Just do something and present what you do with great pride.‚Äô\n",

    "It was the 1920s. A morally and sexually compromised president had come to power promising a regime fundamentally different to his predecessor‚Äôs. The new administration was packed with conmen, hucksters, and unqualified shills raiding the public treasury and selling public lands to Big Oil. There were also those in the cabinet with an agenda that would place inordinate, unbridled power in the hands of corporations while millions of poor Americans took the brunt of a Great Depression that hit before anyone knew what to call it.\n",

    "Greed fever ran like an epidemic in the financial sector giving the illusion of prosperity and wealth when, just underneath, the economy had major fissures and faultlines that threatened to topple the American behemoth. Meanwhile, black people were being terrorised in Tulsa, the Ku Klux Klan was gaining political power in key states in the north, voting rights were under attack, and a new racist immigration law effectively shut the door on anyone not Anglo-Saxon.\n",
    "\n",
    "The international scene was just as vexing. The rise of fascist regimes in Europe and Japan ran headlong into an American retreat from the League of Nations, and by the 1930s there was a growing internal fifth column, marketing itself as ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù, that undermined any effective response to regimes that threatened US national security.\n",
    "In the midst of the maelstrom, an intellectual brawl broke out among African Americans. Unbelievably, the real issue was not the political and economic horror that confronted the nation and black people, who were dealing with massive disparities in access to constitutional rights and wealth. Instead, one African American intellectual openly and mercilessly challenged another over what was essentially ephemera. Du Bois looked on at the row within Fisk University, Tennessee, and shook his head. This peacock display was merely the effervescence of faux bravery. ‚ÄúThe real radical,‚Äù he noted, ‚Äúis the man, who hits power in high places, white power, power backed by unlimited wealth; hits it and hits it openly and between the eyes.‚Äù\n",
    "It‚Äôs 2017. A morally and sexually compromised man has assumed the presidency of the United States. His regime is attacking black and brown people with reckless abandon while, under the guise of ‚ÄúAmerica first‚Äù, shielding Nazis and other white supremacists, and providing no defence against a government that threatens US national security. He and his minions have also unleashed wanton corporate greed, reduced public lands, attacked voting rights, and imposed or threatened immigration restrictions to warm the cockles of any eugenicist.\n",

And this is why the gift of black music, of black art, is unlike any other in America, because it is not simply a matter of singular talent, or even of tradition, or lineage, but of something more grand and monstrous. When Jackson sang and danced, when West samples or rhymes, they are tapping into a power formed under all the killing, all the beatings, all the rape and plunder that made America.

    "Ariana Grande‚Äôs ‚Äú7 Rings‚Äù lets you know, in its very first verse, that it‚Äôs copying. ‚ÄúBreakfast at Tiffany‚Äôs and bottles of bubbles / Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble,‚Äù she sings in place of the ‚ÄúRaindrops on roses / and whiskers on kittens‚Äù made famous by Rodgers and Hammerstein, who are listed among the 10 songwriters for the pop star‚Äôs latest single.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But this is not an Austrian Alps show tune. It‚Äôs a rap and R&B song, inspired by‚Äîor taking from‚Äîblack artists.¬† For the chorus, a marching-formation beat kicks in and Grande whispers, in a clipped rhythm, ‚ÄúI want it, I got it, I want it, I got it.‚Äù In the bridge, she raps in a kind of ranging, liquid style reminiscent of Beyonc√© and Nicki Minaj‚Äôs ‚ÄúFlawless (Remix),‚Äù with a reference to The Notorious B.I.G.‚Äôs ‚ÄúGimme the Loot.‚Äù After the single was released last Friday, two rappers‚ÄîPrincess Nokia and Soulja Boy‚Äîposted videos accusing Grande of stealing their flows. 2 Chainz suggested the music video ripped off the pink trap house he set up as a promotional and public-health effort in Atlanta, and other people noted similarities with his song ‚ÄúSpend It.‚Äù  \n",
    "\n",
    "Whether Grande has a serious plagiarism scandal on her hands is unclear. Rap flows‚Äîparticular verbal rhythms and rhyme patterns‚Äîcan be viral and collaborative things, bubbling up as one emcee‚Äôs innovation then quickly becoming ubiquitous. To my ear, Grande‚Äôs delivery and lyrics do recall all the songs ‚Äú7 Rings‚Äù has been compared to, but not so precisely that you can bet on a slam-dunk copyright-infringement case against her. Then again, we‚Äôre living in the era after the ‚ÄúBlurred Lines‚Äù judgment, which determined that the ‚Äúfeel‚Äù of a song can be actionable. A lawyer just has to convince a jury.   \n",
    "\n",
    "What Grande is definitely facing, though, is that familiar pop-star chapter: a cultural-appropriation backlash. In addition to her extraordinary voice, neurotic charisma, and glittery bath-bomb aesthetic, Grande‚Äôs success has increasingly relied on elements of rap and R&B culture: its slang (last year, issa was every third word Grande said in public), its beats (Pharrell injected her 2018 album, Sweetener, with thump recalling that of his band N.E.R.D), and its stars (all of the guest vocalists on 2016‚Äôs Dangerous Women, the album where she made a show of leaving behind child-star innocence, were black).    \n",
    "\n",
    "This history hasn‚Äôt led to the sort of controversy that, say, met Miley Cyrus when she made herself over as a gold-toothed twerker in 2013. But it has been remarked upon in ways positive and negative. Patti LaBelle lovingly called Grande a ‚Äúlittle white black girl‚Äù while presenting an award to the star in December. But some commentators have grumbled that her ‚Äúblaccent‚Äù and even her spray tan seemed part of an old story about white people profiting off of black aesthetics to project a sense of edge without feeling any of the associated struggle.    \n",
    "\n",
    "Appropriation remains one of the hardest-to-talk-about phenomena in pop culture, which is, fundamentally, a hodgepodge of widely circulated ideas that originated in specific subcultures. One line of thought puts it in economic terms: Are marginalized creators being materially harmed and erased? But on another level, there are questions of aesthetics and tastes. Does the pop star draw upon her influences in a way that feels original? Does her work disrespect or honor those influences? Is there a double standard in how her work is received?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Grande teetered the line on those questions without much incident till now. But ‚Äú7 Rings‚Äù is raising hackles because it regresses to a more cartoonish, and imitative, use of black music than she‚Äôs done before (not to mention the video‚Äôs evocation of Japanese kawaii). She‚Äôs wearing the culture as a costume‚Äîor even as a joke‚Äînot unlike white frat guys putting on fake grills for a ‚Äúratchet‚Äù party.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The lyrical concept for ‚Äú7 Rings‚Äù originated from Grande coping with her super-public breakup from the comedian Pete Davidson last year. After calling off their engagement, she went with six of her best friends to Tiffany, got drunk on champagne, and bought everyone in her posse her own engagement ring. It‚Äôs a tale of mega-wealthy indulgence that‚Äôs both charming and sickening, a combination that Grande tacitly acknowledges with this song. She‚Äôs bragging, not apologizing, about doing something wasteful‚Äîan empowering rebellion, supposedly. ‚ÄúWhoever said money can‚Äôt solve your problems must not have had enough money to solve ‚Äôem,‚Äù she sings.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Grande and her fans would say that this materialist flex is earned defiance for someone who has faced a series of profound public setbacks in recent years, and who‚Äôs been underestimated time and again for being a young woman. They would also say that men get to conduct themselves this way in public all the time. True enough. But the song exploits hip-hop signifiers so insistently that the gap between Grande‚Äôs experiences and the cultures she‚Äôs taking from are as glaring as the reflection off a De Beers product.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The video may or may not reference 2 Chainz‚Äôs pink trap house, but it does channel the notion of a pink trap house via spray paint, beat-up cars, and barking dogs (just look at the album art). The song‚Äôs defining lyric goes, ‚ÄúYou like my hair? / Gee thanks, just bought it,‚Äù which also‚Äîcombined with the rest of her chorus‚Äîrecalls 2 Chainz‚Äôs refrain ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs mine / I spend it.‚Äù But ‚ÄúSpend It‚Äù was a victory lap for someone who‚Äôs had to deal drugs since he was a teenager: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm riding ‚Äôround my side of town / Boxing gloves, I beat the trial.‚Äù On Princess Nokia‚Äôs ‚ÄúMine,‚Äù the chorus, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs mine, I bought it,‚Äù referred to the hairpieces of black and brown women‚Äîwhich, Nokia complained in song, are regularly ridiculed.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Grande‚Äôs hair lyrics, by contrast, are about her famous ponytail and the extensions she buys to create it. That‚Äôs certainly a reference that‚Äôs authentic to her, but also one that draws a shaky connection to former drug dealers having escaped poverty and to women of color showing pride in the face of marginalization. Of course, drawing shaky connections is how all pop music works: Singers‚Äô specific stories offer metaphors that are scalable for all sorts of lifestyles. You can be white and still feel a sense of empowerment by listening to trap. But most listeners at home don‚Äôt then project their fantastical appropriation of someone else‚Äôs struggle to the masses in a hit song about their mega wealth.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Grande has now had to acknowledge the backlash, if not fully reckon with it. On Instagram, she reposted the podcast host Aminatou Sow‚Äôs message ‚ÄúWhite women talking about their weaves is how we‚Äôre gonna solve racism‚Äù and then apologized for doing so, writing about the original post:\n",
    "I think her intention was to be like‚Ä¶ yay a white person disassociating the negative stariotype [sic] that is paired with the word ‚Äòweave‚Äô‚Ä¶ however I‚Äôm so sorry my response was out of pocket or if it came across the wrong way. Thanks for opening the conversation and like‚Ä¶ to everyone for talking to me about it. It‚Äôs never my intention to offend anybody.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It‚Äôs a weird apology. If it helped black women to have a famous white woman brag about her weave, then it would stand to reason that Miley Cyrus‚Äôs butt-shaking phase might have prevented Cardi B and City Girls from being slut-shamed for twerking‚Äîa story that unfolded in the past few days. What culture-jacking often does is simply take advantage of the racist way that different people receive different treatment for the same activities. ‚ÄúWhen black women wear weave it‚Äôs ghetto and trash and we‚Äôre bald,‚Äù tweeted one listener, ‚Äúbut now miss Ariana says that corny ass line everyone and their mom is hype [about] it.‚Äù  \n",
    "\n",
    "Many appropriation critiques incite their own backlash from people who talk about ‚Äúonline mobs‚Äù looking for the next target to ‚Äúcancel.‚Äù But the truth is that even in the face of controversy, ‚Äú7 Rings‚Äù is a streaming smash, and Grande‚Äôs most forceful critics say they‚Äôre not out to destroy a career. ‚ÄúAccountability doesn‚Äôt automatically mean cancel,‚Äù wrote the blogger Erin Dyana. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs literally informing said person of their wrongdoings and offenses, bringing it to their attention and other people‚Äôs attention as well, since we‚Äôre talking about celebrities.‚Äù  \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, depending on how Grande handles this situation, she should be fine. She‚Äôs not someone like Iggy Azalea, who built a career on racial drag. But the fact remains that a sound and an attitude that black artists used to articulate specific things about their lives in a racist society is being pushed further into the realm of catchall clich√©. The average, non-black listener, after being exposed to ‚Äú7 Rings,‚Äù may be less able to discern the particular meanings‚Äîand social circumstances‚Äîof the original documents. In a very real way, Grande has taken other people‚Äôs shine.  \n",

Clearly this line of inquiry begins to border on the fantastic; how much simpler to admit that there is a qualitative difference, a difference in kind, between Shakespeare and every other writer, even Chaucer, even Tolstoy, or whoever.

When he discovered the anxiety of influence some twenty years ago, Bloom‚Äôs faith in the literary text‚Äôs power to serve as a means of understanding and negotiating the existential conundrums raised by this mimetic circularity seemed rather closer to Girard‚Äôs than it appears today. Just a few years before Girard‚Äôs hopeful (but premature) prediction that the ‚Äúgreat theoretical steamrollers of our time‚Äù would soon run out of fuel, Bloom presented, in A Map of Misreading, a stirring exposition of the relevance of his recently formulated idea to his own profession: I remember, as a young man setting out to be a university teacher, how afflicted  \n",

    "The Scapegoat Mechanism\n",
    "In Girard‚Äôs psychology, internal mediation and metaphysical desire eventually lead to rivalry and violence. Imitation eventually erases the differences among human beings, and inasmuch as people become similar to each other, they desire the same things, which leads to rivalries and a Hobbesian war of all against all. These rivalries soon bear the potential to threaten the very existence of communities. Thus, Girard asks: how is it possible for communities to overcome their internal strife?\n",
    "Whereas the philosophers of the 18th century would have agreed that communal violence comes to an end due to a social contract, Girard believes that, paradoxically, the problem of violence is frequently solved with a lesser dose of violence. When mimetic rivalries accumulate, tensions grow ever greater. But, that tension eventually reaches a paroxysm. When violence is at the point of threatening the existence of the community, very frequently a bizarre psychosocial mechanism arises: communal violence is all of the sudden projected upon a single individual. Thus, people that were formerly struggling, now unite efforts against someone chosen as a scapegoat. Former enemies now become friends, as they communally participate in the execution of violence against a specified enemy.\n",
    "Girard calls this process ‚Äòscapegoating‚Äô, an allusion to the ancient religious ritual where communal sins were metaphorically imposed upon a he-goat, and this beast was eventually abandoned in the desert, or sacrificed to the gods (in the Hebrew Bible, this is especially prescribed in Leviticus 16).The person that receives the communal violence is a ‚Äòscapegoat‚Äô in this sense: her death or expulsion is useful as a regeneration of communal peace and restoration of relationships.\n",
    "However, Girard considers it crucial that this process be unconscious in order to work. The victim must never be recognized as an innocent scapegoat (indeed, Girard considers that, prior to the rise of Christianity, ‚Äòinnocent scapegoat‚Äô was virtually an oxymoron; see section 4.b below); rather, the victim must be thought of as a monstrous creature that transgressed some prohibition and deserved to be punished. In such a manner, the community deceives itself into believing that the victim is the culprit of the communal crisis, and that the elimination of the victim will eventually restore peace.\n",

    "The French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu approaches power within the context of a comprehensive ‚Äòtheory of society‚Äô which ‚Äì like that of Foucault ‚Äì we can‚Äôt possibly do justice to here, or easily express in the form of applied methods (Navarro 2006). And although his subject was mainly Algerian and French society, we have found Bourdieu‚Äôs approach useful in analysing power in development and social change processes (see the articles by Navarro, Moncrieffe, Eyben and Taylor and Boser in Eyben, Harris et. al. 2006; Navarro offers a particularly solid introduction to Bourdieu‚Äôs method).\n",
    "\n",
    "While Foucault sees power as ‚Äòubiquitous‚Äô and beyond agency or structure, Bourdieu sees power as culturally and symbolically created, and constantly re-legitimised through an interplay of agency and structure. The main way this happens is through what he calls ‚Äòhabitus‚Äô or socialised norms or tendencies that guide behaviour and thinking. Habitus is ‚Äòthe way society becomes deposited in persons in the form of lasting dispositions, or trained capacities and structured propensities to think, feel and act in determinant ways, which then guide them‚Äô (Wacquant 2005: 316, cited in Navarro 2006: 16).\n",
    "\n",
    "Habitus is created through a social, rather than individual process leading to patterns that are enduring and transferrable from one context to another, but that also shift in relation to specific contexts and over time. Habitus ‚Äòis not fixed or permanent, and can be changed under unexpected situations or over a long historical period‚Äô (Navarro 2006: 16):\n",
    "\n",
    "Habitus is neither a result of free will, nor determined by structures, but created by a kind of interplay between the two over time: dispositions that are both shaped by past events and structures, and that shape current practices and structures and also, importantly, that condition our very perceptions of¬† these (Bourdieu 1984: 170). In this sense habitus is created and reproduced unconsciously, ‚Äòwithout any deliberate pursuit of coherence‚Ä¶ without any conscious concentration‚Äô (ibid: 170).\n",
    "\n",
    "A second important concept introduced by Bourdieu is that of ‚Äòcapital‚Äô, which he extends beyond the notion of material assets to capital that may be social, cultural or symbolic (Bourdieu 1986: cited in Navarro 2006: 16). These forms of capital may be equally important, and can be accumulated and transferred from one arena to another (Navarro 2006: 17). Cultural capital ‚Äì and the means by which it is created or transferred from other forms of capital ‚Äì plays a central role in societal power relations, as this ‚Äòprovides the means for a non-economic form of domination and hierarchy, as classes distinguish themselves through taste‚Äô (Gaventa 2003: 6). The shift from material to cultural and symbolic forms of capital is to a large extent what hides the causes of inequality.\n",
    "\n",
    "These ideas are elaborated at length in Bourdieu‚Äôs classic study of French society, Distinction (1986), in which he shows how the ‚Äòsocial order is progressively inscribed in people‚Äôs minds‚Äô through ‚Äòcultural products‚Äô including systems of education, language, judgements, values, methods of classification and activities of everyday life (1986: 471). These all lead to an unconscious acceptance of social differences and hierarchies, to ‚Äòa sense of one‚Äôs place‚Äô and to behaviours of self-exclusion (ibid: 141).\n",
    "\n",
    "A third concept that is important in Bourdieu‚Äôs theory is the idea of ‚Äòfields‚Äô, which are the various social and institutional arenas in which people express and reproduce their dispositions, and where they compete for the distribution of different kinds of capital (Gaventa 2003: 6). A field is a network, structure or set of relationships which may be intellectual, religious, educational, cultural, etc. (Navarro 2006: 18). People often experience power differently depending which field they are in at a given moment (Gaventa 2003: 6), so context and environment are key influences on habitus:\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ÄòBourdieu (1980) accounts for the tensions and contradictions that arise when people encounter and are challenged by different contexts. His theory can be used to explain how people can resist power and domination in one [field] and express complicity in another‚Äô (Moncrieffe 2006: 37)\n",
    "\n",
    "Fields help explain the differential power, for example, that women experience in public or private, as Moncrieffe shows in her interview with a Ugandan woman MP who has public authority but is submissive to her husband when at home (2006: 37).¬† This has been widely observed by feminist activists and researchers, and is another way of saying that women and men are socialised to behave differently in ‚Äòpublic, private and intimate‚Äô arenas of power (VeneKlasen and Miller 2002). See gender perspectives on power and a New Weave of Power chapter 3 Power and Empowerment.\n",
    "\n",
    "A final important concept in Bourdieu‚Äôs understanding of power is that of ‚Äòdoxa‚Äô, which is the combination of both orthodox and heterodox norms and beliefs ‚Äì the unstated, taken-for-granted assumptions or ‚Äòcommon sense‚Äô behind the distinctions we make. Doxa happens when we ‚Äòforget the limits‚Äô that have given rise to unequal divisions in society: it is ‚Äòan adherence to relations of order which, because they structure inseparably both the real world and the thought world, are accepted as self-evident‚Äô (Bourdieu 1984: 471).\n",
    "\n",
    "Bourdieu also uses the term ‚Äòmisrecognition‚Äô, which is akin to Marxian ideas of¬† ‚Äòfalse consciousness‚Äô (Gaventa 2003: 6), but working at a deeper level that transcends any intent at conscious manipulation by one group or another. Unlike the Marxian view, ‚Äòmisrecognition‚Äô is more of a cultural than an ideological phenomenon, because it ‚Äòembodies a set of active social processes that anchor taken-for-granted assumptions into the realm of social life and, crucially, they are born in the midst of culture. All forms of power require legitimacy and culture is the battleground where this conformity is disputed and eventually materialises amongst agents, thus creating social differences and unequal structures‚Äô (Navarro 2006: 19).\n",
    "\n",
    "While much of this may sound abstract, Bourdieu‚Äôs theories are firmly grounded in a wide body of sociological research, and across a range of social issues. Part of his appeal, in fact, is that his research is so prolific and empirically documented. Another appeal of Bourdieu for politically committed researchers is that he sees sociological method as part of the process of change. Careful analysis can help to reveal the power relations that have been rendered invisible by habitus and misrecognition (Navarro 2006: 19).\n",
    "\n",
    "Bourdieu proposed a ‚Äòreflexive sociology‚Äô‚Äì in which one recognises one‚Äôs biases, beliefs and assumptions in the act of sense-making ‚Äì long before reflexivity became fashionable.¬† Self-critical knowledge that discloses the ‚Äòsources of power‚Äô and¬† reveals ‚Äòthe reasons that explain social asymmetries and hierarchies‚Äô can itself become ‚Äòa powerful tool to enhance social emancipation‚Äô (Navarro 2006: 15-16).\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods and terminology used by Bourdieu are distinct from those used in the powercube, and suggest much more detailed sociological analysis of power relations rooted in a comprehensive ‚Äòtheory of society‚Äô. Yet the implications for applied analysis and action resonate very strongly with the meanings of internalised, invisible power and ‚Äòpower within‚Äô, and with the implicit ‚Äòtheory of change‚Äô in the powercube, This is the idea that understanding power and powerlessness, especially through processes of learning and analysis that expose invisible power, cat itself be an empowering process\n",

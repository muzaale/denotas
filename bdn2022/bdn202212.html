Whence evil?
The answer!
United these :)

Views:
1.Tragic — everything is meaningless. So there’s no such thing as evil. Its just bad luck
2.Comic — mistaken identity. Most recluse fella isn’t immune to mistaken identity 
3.Evil — in other words, evil mistakes the recluse for some other it is targeting

12/07/22


Part I: 
I think a fundamental logical fallacy in “Big Sugar’s Secret Ally? Nutritionists” is to mistake cause with effect (1). The basic hypothesis of the article is that the 655% increase in prevalence of Americans with diabetes over the last 60 years is caused by an increase in consumption of sugar. 

However, the true causal relationship is that diabetes causes an increase in blood sugar levels, not the other way around wherein increased blood sugar levels (from dietary sources) increase likelihood of diabetes.

What causes diabetes? More specifically, what causes type-II diabetes (the epidemic kind)? The answer is an increased resistance to the effects of insulin, arising often from a change in body composition with more percent body fat than muscle. Adipose tissue is insulin resistant.

And the cause of increased body fat over the last 60 years is reduced physical activity and more or less sedentary life style amongst Americans of most ages. 

To say obesity is caused “by a lack of energy balance” is incontestable. The article correctly quotes the NIH in saying “in other words, by our taking in more calories than we expend.” But then the author reveals their bias by focusing on the “taking in more calories” and completely neglecting the “more than we expend.” Hence, the entire article focuses on how food may influence our body weight through their caloric content.”

But how about how increased activity and exercise may moderate our appetite and thus our calorie intake (2)? This question uncovers the authors biased question and article title. It blinds us to the cause of dietary intake, namely, the hormones and endorphins that regulate our appetite in the first place.

Modern persons at all the stages of life including childhood, teenage, young adulthood, middle life, and later life have drastically reduced outdoor activity. Many more more video games, increased indoor entertainment through television, sprawling of suburbs and reliance on cars for every mode of movement (from home to grocery store, to school, to work, etc.) and such pattern have increased exponentially over the last 60 years and are the fundamental problem. Sedentary people eat more than active ones. So dietary intake is an effect arising from physical inactivity. 

Of course the consequence of the logical fallacy discussed here is the focus on diet and nutrition instead of physical activity, lifestyle, and environmental engineering that may nudge individuals back to what their ancestors did: more physical activity for daily tasks. 


Part II:

My favorite example of a statistical fallacy comes from American politics but may as well apply to clinical studies. Over the last 40 years, the American senate has had either a majority democrat or republican representation. But by majority I mean 51% (majority party) vs. 49% (minority party) of the 100 senators, two from each state. Just today, with Georgia’s senate runoff election complete, the democrats hold 51 of the 100 senate seats (3). 

Those is the majority interpret this as the electoral mandate of the people who have chosen them over their rivals.

But when you subject this to statistical inference this is essentially not different from the toss of a coin or a random electoral event bearing absolutely no meaning. When you toss a coin 100 times (to elect the senators), that may count as a sample size of n=100. And the majority of 51% may count as p=0.51. The standard error is given by the square root of p(1-p)/n, 0.05. Thus such a slim majority is 51% (95% CI: 41.2%-60.8%).

Here we see that this isn’t statistically significantly different from the null-hypothesis from a coin toss (pure chance, luck) of 50%.

12/12/22

i guess i have a more playful approach to (not being but… )
becoming a better member of the audience:
my sport is to take what the performer mistakes

“Art being to a certain degree a mode of acting, an attempt to realise one&#39;s own personality on some imaginative plane out of reach of the trammelling accidents and limitations of real life, to censure an artist for a forgery was to confuse an ethical with an aesthetical problem.” 
― Oscar Wilde, The Portrait of Mr. W.H.

Do we mistake an aesthetic issue
For an ethical issue?
Can we be offended by 
A horrid performance?
This is perhaps my Q!

<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span> Emory Report	
April 5, 1999

 Volume 51, No. 26


First person:

Reflections on an over-examined life: navel gazers unite!

It&#39;s high time someone gave us political recognition. Not that we&#39;d ever actually vote, of course. We&#39;re far too busy working through The Artist&#39;s Way to leave the apartment for anything other than brie and cigarettes. But we like the idea of voting. We like the idea that social change is but an election ballot away--and personal transformation is as easy as e-mail.

If television personality Ally McBeal and radio therapist Dr. Laura Schlessinger were inverse halves of the same brain, they would exemplify the mind of the Postmodern Navel Gazer: the gourmet cheese-loving, expensively educated, Gen-X individualists who spend our waking hours trying to have our pain and ease it too. Heads without bodies (with sporadic alcohol-induced reversals), we applaud Dr. Laura&#39;s self-help sound bites while at the same time empathizing with Ally&#39;s endless neuroses. Is this fuzz in my navel lint or inconsistency?

At least three assumptions characterize the navel gazing mentality as I understand it:

Assumption 1: You believe that desire is better than satiation and take steps to ensure that you always want that which you can never have. Happiness is not sexy. Longing is.
Assumption 2: You boast a nihilistic exterior yet secretly believe The Truth is out there. But you want X-Files Agent Scully to find it for you. She&#39;s not a poet and she&#39;s not emaciated, so she has more time and energy than you to do that sort of thing.
Assumption 3: You gravitate toward quick-fix solutions to complex psychological and social problems. This Minute Rice approach helps ensure that while you continue to self-destruct, you can relax in the belief that change is just around the bend--should you ever decide to get out of bed and look for it.
Take my friend Gwen as an example. Gwen worships Dr. Laura with religious intensity. Her bookshelf displays Ten Stupid Things Women Do to Mess Up Their Lives at one end and, to placate the feminists, Ten Stupid Things Men Do at the other. She listens faithfully to Dr. Laura&#39;s daily denunciations of codependence, moral indecision, working mothers and drug-puffing teens. &quot;Instant therapy,&quot; Gwen calls her show.

Of course, she never actually follows Dr. Laura&#39;s advice. That would be taking things to an extreme. No, Gwen is quite content remaining, like Ally, perpetually unhappy; she&#39;s addicted to The English Patient and to angst-ridden Ally McBeal list-servs. She complains of having lost her &quot;passion&quot; for religion. She repeats relational mistakes dozens of times, then spends Kleenex-filled evenings rereading old journals. How could she have time to pursue a healthy relationship, a spiritual life or meaningful work? Thousands of eighth grade diary pages are still waiting to be deconstructed!

Every so often I experience doubts about the implications of postmodern navel gazing. Periodically I wake to looming questions I would rather let Scully--or maybe a licensed ethicist--address. What are the moral, social and political consequences of an over-examined life? Can a person care responsibly for his or her &quot;self&quot; without becoming solipsistic and without abandoning responsibility to the common or public good? Does Generation X need an ethic of self-reflection?

One could argue, after all, that Dr. Laura&#39;s tactics for self-reflection are highly unethical. She interrupts working mothers with unjustified accusations of greed and selfishness. She applies careless verbal Band-Aids to gaping psychological and social wounds. She doesn&#39;t listen; she simply swoops in for the therapeutic kill.

One could also argue that Dr. Laura is as myopic as her waifish opposite. Ally&#39;s television show is a celebration of destructive behavior; Dr. Laura&#39;s radio show is a two-second &quot;solution&quot; to lifelong patterns of destructive behavior. Neither program bothers to distinguish between damaging versus constructive forms of self-examination. Neither pauses to consider the consequences of representing ethical and psychological lethargy as entertainment.

Thankfully, however, I have discovered that coffee and cigarettes provide an excellent antidote to such bothersome late-night misgivings. Armed with mug and cancer stick, I can proclaim to my rapt stuffed animals that while solipsism, social responsibility and myopic stagnation might be worth addressing, I personally do not have the time or luxury to look into any of them.

This is because I am busy perfecting my use of the navel gazer&#39;s favorite academic term: &quot;paradox.&quot; Paradox is a good word because it allows us to be as contradictory as possible without having to explain our actions or justify a lack of personal ethics. For example:

Question: &quot;But Stacia, how can you applaud Dr. Laura&#39;s absolutist moralistic tone while at the same time wallowing in Ally&#39;s haze of moral and personal ambiguity?&quot; Answer: &quot;It&#39;s a paradox!&quot;

See how handy the word is? Thank God for higher education.

Navel gazers, take heart: Contrary to what that awful therapist once told you, being pathologically unhappy or perpetually self-destructive is not a bad thing. Our supposed flaws are actually rare gifts: They not only provide poetic distraction from healthy relationships and from life&#39;s deepest questions, they also make terrific diet aids. Just look at Ally: She&#39;s so busy chewing on her own personal drama, her body has disappeared almost entirely.

Now that&#39;s what I call self-absorption.

12/21/22

Viagra was developed and studied in phase I clinical trials for hypertension and angina pectoris (1). It’s therapeutic effects were not substantive and did not reach phase II or III trials. But a commonly reported side effect in the phase I trial was the induction of marked penile erections (2).

Pfizer immediately recognized its commercial potential and patented it in 1996. It was then repositioned for erectile dysfunction and was approved for erectile dysfunction by FDA within a mere two years(3).

Within 3 months of FDA licensing in 1998 (4), Pfizer had earned $400m from viagra and over the next 20 years leading to expiry of its patent in 2020 the annual earnings from the sale of viagra were $1.2 - $2.0b, with a cumulative total of $27.6b as of 2020 (5).

The market for viagra and its competitors is expected to continue growing according to the WHO. Increased burden of lifestyle disease and sedentary lifestyle interact to cause erectile dysfunction. At a prevalence of 15% of the male population, it is projected by WHO to reach 320m persons by 2025 (6). Such is the story of an entirely serendipitous discovery by otherwise astute scientists and clinicians that were meticulous enough to profit from unintended consequences.

Dear GTPCI Advisory Committee members,

I have discussed the issue regarding my mentorship plan with Dr. Segev and the Department of Surgery.  We do not expect a substantial impact on my GTPCI plans for the following reasons:  

1. Dr. Segev will be keeping an adjust appointment with the JHU Department of Surgery;
2. For the last two years we’ve mostly communicated via zoom and email and will continue to do so on a weekly basis;
3. Our research group at JHU will continue close collaborations with the Dorry’s research group at NYU;
4. I will continue to have access to the data sources required for my research topic.

Because the GTPCI PhD is an integral part of my K08 career development plans, we have also addressed this issue with the National Institute of Aging. I’ve attached a copy of the letter for your convenience.

In the mountains the shortest way is from peak to peak, but for that route thou must have long legs. Proverbs should be peaks, and those spoken to should be big and tall

I no longer feel in common with you; the very cloud which I see beneath me, the blackness and heaviness at which I laugh—that is your thunder-cloud

And to me also, who appreciate life, the butterflies, and soap-bubbles, and whatever is like them amongst us, seem most to enjoy happiness.

To see these light, foolish, pretty, lively little sprites flit about—that moveth Zarathustra to tears and songs

I should only believe in a God that would know how to dance.

And when I saw my devil, I found him serious, thorough, profound, solemn: he was the spirit of gravity—through him all things fall.

Not by wrath, but by laughter, do we slay. Come, let us slay the spirit of gravity!

Robert Sapolsky’s on categorical thinking, origin of error
Evolution from Ape to man is not categorical, no “civilized”
The first nine aphorisms in Human, All Too Human
Cause and effect in Nietzsche’s writings on 02/28/22
Missing data lecture by Elizabeth Sugar on 03/01/22
And thoughts of Constantine Frangakis also on 03/01/22
Wittes et all dilemma as the DSMB of WHI studies of several exposures and outcomes

A complexity which is thousandfold reaches our consciousness as a simple entity — Nietzsche, 1888

No aphorism is more frequently repeated in connection with field trials, than that we must ask Nature few questions, or ideally one question, at a time. The writer is convinced that this view is wholly mistaken. Nature he suggests, will best respond to a logical and carefully thought out questionnaire.” 
— R.A. Fisher, 1926 

I develop designs and methods of analyses to evaluate treatments in medicine, public health and policy (causal inference) — Frangakis, 2002
 

*

Association between increased sophistication of analyses and number of assumptions made?
Randomized trials are not exempt given factor design, multiple outcomes, adverse effects, follow-up t
I mistrust all systematizers and avoid them. The will to a system is a lack of integrity — Nietzsche 

*

I have never pondered over questions that are not questions. I have never squandered my strength. Of actual religious difficulties, for instance, I have no experience. I have never known what it feels to be “sinful”

*

To conclude, we value creation more than searching; engineering more than science; practical more than theoretical

Through a Glass Darkly, 

Perhaps I stabbed our SaviorIn His sacred helpless side.Yet I’ve called His name in blessingWhen in after times I died.
Through the travail of the agesMidst the pomp and toil of warHave I fought and strove and perishedCountless times upon this star.
I have sinned and I have sufferedPlayed the hero and the knaveFought for belly, shame or countryAnd for each have found a grave.
So as through a glass and darklyThe age long strife I seeWhere I fought in many guises,Many names – but always me.
So forever in the futureShall I battle as of yore,Dying to be born a fighterBut to die again once more.

Slide 1: Title

I’m going talk to you about the.. 
So.. A key part of donor evaluation is the estimation of the donor candidates risks, communicating these to the donor candidate, and reaching a shared decision on whether its appropriate to proceed with donation


Slide 2: Frank

Now.. A knowledge gap exists in our understanding of the risks faced by older donors
Here we have Frank, the oldest living donor to date – 84yo (Linda — 72yo neighbor). The informed consent process in this case could not have been based on actual data from older donors (i.e., maybe extrapolations from younger donors)


Slide 3: Data

To address this knowledge gap, I’ll be using national registry data to enumerate all the older donors in the US

Slide 4: Analysis

We can thus quantify the risks attributable to donation… the kind of information that is currently lacking for older donors.. and to be shared during the informed consent process


Slide 5: Challenges

Preceding outcomes that affect quality of life 

No Gerontological syndromes not captured by ICD-10 codes.. 
Our findings will inform the conversation between candidate and provider about the propriety of donation 

*NIS

Slide 6: Goals

These ideas translate into the following specific research aims: Our efforts will culminate in the creation of online risk calculators that inform the conversation between candidates and providers about the propriety of donation. Dr. Muzaale will learn how sentinel hospitalization events in an aging cohort of older donors leave a footprint of present and missing 

Aim 1 &amp; 2: info for medical community 
Aim 3: more accessible info for donor candidates 


Slide 7: Online-Calculators
A.
Nonparametric hazard of the base-case; maximum-likelihood estimate of the difference (on a log scale) between the hazard of the base-case and the hazard for the specific-case with explanatory variables X, and t-years (using base-case absolute risks and specific-case relative risk coefficients from the multivariable regression in Aims 1 and 2)


B.
In a manner analogous to what I just described for risk of ESRD/death, we will use multivariable logistic regression to describe nephrectomy attributable hospitalizations, associated medical diagnoses. Beta– maximum likelihood estimate of the additive effect on the log odds for a unit change in a given explanatory variable X

To die proudly when it is no longer possible to live proudly. Death freely chosen, death at the right time, brightly and cheerfully accomplished amid children and witnesses: then a real farewell is still possible..

This monk, with all the vengeful instincts of an unsuccessful priest in him, raised a rebellion against the Renaissance in Rome.... Instead of grasping, with profound thanksgiving, the miracle that had taken place: the conquest of Christianity at its capital — instead of this, his hatred was stimulated by the spectacle. 

A religious man thinks only of himself. — Luther saw only the depravity of the papacy at the very moment when the opposite was becoming apparent: the old corruption, the peccatum originale, Christianity itself, no longer occupied the papal chair! 

Instead there was life! Instead there was the triumph of life! Instead there was a great yea to all lofty, beautiful and daring things!... And Luther restored the church: he attacked it.... The Renaissance — an event without meaning, a great futility! — Ah, these Germans, what they have not cost us! 

Futility — that has always been the work of the Germans. — The Reformation; Leibnitz; Kant and so-called German philosophy; the war of “liberation”; the empire — every time a futile substitute for something that once existed, for something irrecoverable....

Ambitious
L’homme moyen

Mark 8: 34-38 : For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?

Examples of slacker protagonist becoming ambitious (aka losing their soul)
1.Henry V
2.William James
3.Not “The Dude”!
4.Cédric
5.[XXX]


“To those who want to know where the hell’s my ambition, I say: and you, where the hell’s your well-being? Usually they stammer a few words and I understand by them that they’ve postponed it. Because first, they need:

1.Money (and a job);
2.Husband/wife;
3.Car;
4.A house; and,
5.Retirement plan

And people say I’m the one wasting my time!

#life

Life = Will to Power
Evasion = Numbing this Will
Methods = Ideology or Chemicals

x

Will (to do)
Desire (to be)
Senses 🐘 🦒 🦓 🦔 🐄 🐅 

Only alcohol can keep man in hedonism 

x

She should have died hereafter;
There would have been a time for such a word.--
To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,
To the last syllable of recorded time;
And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
Life&#39;s but a walking shadow; a poor player,
That struts and frets his hour upon the stage,
And then is heard no more: it is a tale
Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
Signifying nothing 

Ambition — thou shalt be king 
Meaning — signifying nothing 
Pleasure — increases the desire?

No, alcohol merely inhibits mans will 
Or numbs man whose will is too weak to climb 
What is left are base instincts, sensualist, etc

When I reach 200% of my move goal for the hundredth time (presently at 92), then I’ll refine my activity goals as follows:

1.Burning 1000 active calories 
2.After accounting for a 400-500 baseline 
3.Therefore I estimate the goal to 1500 calories 

Let’s make this work!!

#butterfly

05/29/22

Maggie, a 48yo WF, says I’m a source of inspiration to her and her two daughters

She told the daughters about a man who decided to challenge himself and learn butterfly

x

Valentine (Redhead, Off White)
Natalie (Black girl)

Shared lanes with these two badass young ladies
At the end the black girl said I’m an inspiration
To her and to many others I’m not even aware of
Because I’m a black man who seems to be a
Professional and badass at butterfly

x

THANK YOU!

x

Ambition: Learn butterfly at 41yo
Meaning: Inspire others by my success
Pleasure: Badass body that could get them xxx

Have you ever read the Theogony? It’s a fairly short book, although a fascinating account of the Greek gods. The Iliad and The Odyssey are epic works. So that’s for starters. I would argue that the Iliad and the Odyssey are also just more interesting, being histories that had it all: war, murder, rape, betrayal, adultery, gods, witches, magic, victory, defeat, misfortune, revenge, vindication—you name it, it’s in the Iliad or the Odyssey. Each of them could make a fine mini-series!
                                                                                               —    Bryan Roth


Because it’s rubbish.

I’m joking, of course. To an extent. But the Theogony isn’t as famous as the Homeric epics for a number of reasons!

Firstly, it isn’t a coherent narrative in the same way as Homer’s works are. It’s really more of an epic catalogue (which, as we’ll know from the catalogue of ships in Iliad 2, are everyone’s favourite parts of an ancient text… not).

It’s also significant that the Homeric epics document a very popular set of stories — the Epic Cycle was epic indeed! Battles at Troy? Enduring heroes struggling to get home? Mythical monsters? Everyone wants to hear about those! Can we really pretend that a blunt list of the 50+ children of ‘Nereus and rich-haired Doris’ is as gripping as Achilles telling Hektor he’d like to hack him up and eat his flesh raw?

It hasn’t been studied in the school system (ancient to modern) like the Homeric epics have been; that’s one of the main reasons for the tenacity of Homer’s works — they’ve been very popular for a long time! The Theogony just hasn’t been treated with quite so much affection, over the years… it isn’t as easy to read, nor necessarily as much of a pleasure.

The Theogony also just isn’t quite as impressive as the Homeric epics. It’s only about 1000 lines, compared to the Odyssey’s ~12,000, or the Iliad’s ~15,000.
                                                                                               —    Amy Dakin

Nietzsche=Mozart

Claims of originality (Freud)
Or influence of descendants (Beethoven)

It is Beethoven’s descendants who lose interest in everything preceding him
Whether to blame this on Beethoven himself is irrelevant
He held Mozart in high esteem:

Blame his offspring?

1.It’s summer vacation (for many)
2.And beginning of the year (for us in medicine: day 1 is July 1st)
3.Makes impromptu meetings near impossible
4.So my goals is to walk you around to appreciate infrastructure (key for medicine!!!)
5.Visit again but with schedule to meet and agenda (calendars booked till June 2023)
6.Between September 7 — June 30 is best 

— University: Rules of aesthetics 
— Accreditation in the US
— Students then may visit for electives
— In return American universities may collaborate with $$
— Growth and much more
— Meeting with administrators tricky without these!!#
— Tripartite mission of education, service, research
— Shuttle service across campuses embodying tripartite mission!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
— Virtually impossible to claim these without a sort of footprint
— Medical School, Teaching Hospitals, Peer-reviewed Publications

07/10/22
Milestone
— Exactly 6wk without calorie count:
— 05/30/22 was 365th day of use
— Weighed in at 178lbs on the day
— Qualitative documentation of all intake in the interim
— Comprehensive graphical summary available
— Photos may be found on 07/10/22 meals
— Now 1wk left to complete hiatus:
— Resume daily logging thereafter
— Strict adherence to calorie budget 
— Holding debt not permitted ever again 
— See if weight is still 178lbs on resumption!
— Does this mean my budget is too restrictive if still 178lbs?

Coherent
— Food 05/30/22 - 07/15/22: 700 calories over 45 days = 15.6 calories/day
— But this was scaled to 0.01 to allow me to “catchup” and return to schedule
— So its really 1,560 calories/day and a total of 70,000 calories over 45 days
— May reappraise this to 2,000 calories/day and 60,000 calories per month
— Empirical verification: 30,000 calories total on Activity App at each months end
— Nice, rounded, muscle building, familiar 1000/day burn!

Reappraisal
— Lets see how this is working on 07/15/22
— Then figure out how to consistently burn 1000 calories per day
— Swim, rower, other stuff, spare hip as much as possible

“Hospitals across the United States are throwing away less-than-perfect organs and denying the sickest people lifesaving transplants out of fear that poor surgical outcomes will result in a federal crackdown”

— 1954, Boston. First successful solid organ (kidney) transplant in history: living kidney donor
— 1963, Pittsburg. First successful live transplant in history: deceased donor
— 1967, Capetown. First successful heat transplant in history: deceased donor
— rollout across N. America, S. Africa, Europe, Asia
— later rollout to Egypt, Nigeria, Kenya
— Uganda yet to join global transplant community
— Meanwhile patients with indications for transplantation have two options
— Tremendous resources for transplant tourism vs. death sentence
— Propose bill to remove necessity of transplant tourism and foster local access for all
— Improve longevity and quality of life of those who would otherwise be given a death sentence
— Model after S. Africa, culturally the closest success-story with locally relevant experiences
— Any existing laws on blood transfusion? How do these change with Part I: 3. Application?

Commentary
*MEMORANDUM
1.POLICY AND PRINCIPLES
— Motivation? Vague! Leaning towards ethics vs. functionality
— How about mortality? Death sentence for those without resources to travel?
— No Ugandan laws in place but templates available and must be stated at the outset
— Allows us to go straight to the nuances: choose NA,  Europe, or Asia as template
— Explicitly declare what template we’ll go after and then proceed from there

Principle XX of UG constitution:
“State shall take all practical measures to ensure the provision of basic medical services to the population” Omit the “protect Ugandans from being victims of organ, cell and tissue trafficking.”

Lets be more functional than moralist, more alive than dull, more empirical than theoretical 

2.DEFECTS IN THE EXISTING LAW
— Language inappropriate
— Can’t have defect where no law exists
— Prevention of trafficking can’t be motivation!
— Reducing transplant tourism to India can’t be motivation
— Microcosm of entire health sector: witnessing symptoms of problems
— Allow de-centralized innovation and let government stick to regulation of sector!

3.REMEDIES PROPOSED TO DEAL WITH DEFECTS
(B) designate Mulago National Referral Hospital as the pioneering transplant center
— Naive since a network of centers is key to success from onset (2)
— Should have member hospital centers as basis of Uganda Organ and Transplant Council
— With other stakeholders including GoU and maybe neighboring countries like Sudan, Congo, Rwanda? 
— Local organ procuring organizations that may compete &amp; collaborate (3)
— HLA typing, overcoming immunological barriers via swaps (4, 5, 6)
— Post-transplant care is lifetime and should not be local: not Kampala! (7)
— Expertise built at center-level by sending trainees to Univ. of Capetown (0, 1)

(G) establish standards for storage of harvested organs, tissues and cells
— This may be of very little relevance to solid organ transplant
— Here logistical barriers are the key concern: transplant within 8hrs of harvest!!!!

*PART I. Preliminary: removal, storage &amp; transplantation vs. harvest, transport &amp; implant 
*PART II. Minister and transplant council vs. opo, logistics &amp; surgeons
*PART III. Finances of council vs. steakholders: GoU, business &amp; centers
*PART IV. Designation of transplant centers vs. all hospitals members, some voting members
*PART V. Additional requirements vs. from non-voting to voting member
*PART VI. Quality assurance: performance metrics, contract academic/statistical SRTR
*Part VII. Storage of organs, tissues, cells: transport not storage
*Part VIII. Transplant of organs, tissues, cells: ?????
*Part IX. Post-mortem of BDD: EEG? Post-mortem unnecessary cost
*Part X. Database and reporting requirements (Contract????): see Part VI — peer-reviewed
*Part XI. Offenses and penalties: legal stuff that is not my area of speciality
*Part XII. Miscellaneous: detailed study of South African laws

PART I.
— Provide for a system to ensure equitable access to transplantation services for patients
— This should be #1 rather than buried in text as if it were a “by the way..” 
— Once logistics for this are set up then we can organically leverage the infrastructure to…
— Ensure traceability of organs, tissues and cells and recall procedures
— Reduce verbosity of document to these two elements (i.e., primary vs. secondary)

PART II.
— The Minister shall provide information and increase awareness about organ transplantation
— Opt in at time of national ID registration? That’s how America does it
— Family reserves power to override patients decision after death

PART IV.
28.Designation of transplant centers
— Mulago is designated as the pioneer transplant center
— This is a false start and should strongly be discouraged
— Because Transplantation at its core is all about logistics
— With resources that can’t be concentrated in Kampala
— Such as deceased donor organ at a given time
— And the most compatible match for that deceased donor organ
— Only nationwide registries at OPO level would minimize asymmetries of info
— Reminder: post-transplant care must be de-centralized to ensure lifetime access
— Can’t see how designating a pioneer center helps this cause
— Stifles innovation and merely delays progress

29.Application for designation as transplant center
— All medical centers should be represented in the Council
— Only those doing transplants may be voting members
— Ensures transparency of process towards membership
— Criteria for membership should be open, automatic and not for Minister to interpret 

30.Qualification for designation as transplant center
— Two adjacent theaters; one for the donor and another for the recipient. Only necessary in the case of living donor transplantation, and only if the donor is in the same hospital
— Deceased donor transplantation never has such needs as organ harvesting or procurement is performed at the center where the donor was declared brain dead. This site is almost certainly never the same as the recipient center, since there is a waitlist and also HLA-compatibility issues that often lead to the logistical necessity of transporting a procured organ from one center to another 
— Living donor transplantation on the other hand is often performed in two adjacent theaters. As such, this item uncovers unstated assumptions about deceased donor vs. living donor transplantation across the entire bill. These should be explicitly stated at the outset!

31.Designation by Minister
— There shouldn’t be any role for Minister in designating a hospital a transplant centers
— Open and transparent criteria are sufficient 
— As such a hospital should automatically be considered eligible once it meets these
— Center should then be invited to (or should itself)) submit the application
— It should expect to be granted status unless criteria insufficient 
— Process should be open to both voting and non-voting members
— (6) A hospital seeking to be designated to undertake cadaveric transplantation shall be required to get additional approval. Cadaveric is an out-of-fashion term. We now say Deceased donor transplantation. Also, this statement once again tells us that the unstated assumption is that living donor transplantation is the default mode where no adjective such as deceased donor is used. I believe this makes the bill vague and poorly worded and should be revised in its entirely to make the distinction between living donor and deceased donor transplantation from the outset. 

32.Existing centers
— Quality/Performance metrics may render a center sub-par 
— This should be grounds for temporary suspension of license 
— Pending reappraisal of issues that led to suspension

34.Approval of banks
— For solid organ transplantation there is no such thing as “banks”
— Organs remain viable only within an 8 hour window of procurement 
— The case for tissues and cells is different and this should be made clear

37.Education services to the public
— (4) Every designated transplant center shall produce or have available literature and media items that provide education and awareness creation for donation of organs, tissues, and cells
— For any of the outlined issues to be empirically based (i.e., scientific), Transplant centers will have to derived from peer-reviewed research. This item is lacking from the bill
— I propose that the database that is established for regulatory purposes should not only be used to ensure traceability of organs and prevent trafficking, but also be put to use in registry-based research with annual reports published in a peer-reviewed journal such as Makerere’s African Journal of Health Sciences 


— Non-designated transplant centers and academic institutions should have access to registry data for research purposes. These data may be de-identified to comply with patient privacy

Part VI.
40.Organ Donation and Transport Quality Control System
(e) a database for all potential recipients and donors. I propose the name Uganda Network for Organ Sharing — UNOS. This serves as a reminder that the designation of Mulago as the pioneer center is misguided and potentially harmful to innovation and growth of a truly de-centralized network of organ sharing. 

41.Quality assurance programmes
Internal audit or risk management. A competitive contract may be issued to academic or statistical agencies, carrying the name SRTR — Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients. This registry will obtain regulatory and administrative data from UNOS and use it to quantify clinical outcomes such as death while on the waitlist, time from waitlist to transplant, allograft failure after transplant, immunosuppressive therapy used after transplant, primary graft non-function, survival after transplant, etc. 

The SRTR will produce annual peer-reviewed publications that summarize key metrics. However, the SRTR should also make its data available to third-parties, who may also use it for academic and peer-reviewed research. 

Only such an arrangement will ensure transparency, high quality appraisal of clinical outcomes, and center-level performance compared with the national average or some such benchmark. 

45.Preservation of organs, tissues and cells.
— This may only apply to tissues and cells, never to organs!

48.Review of donor medical information
— Prior to the distribution of any organ, tissue or cell for transplantation, the registered medical practiional of a bank… 
— In the case of living donor transplantation, this is meaningless since the donated organ will be in an adjacent operating theater to the one of the recipient
— So this mostly applies to deceased donor transplantation. As such, the entire bill remains somewhat confused about this distinction, which is not made at the outset. 

PART VIII.
52.National waiting list
— Every patient indicated for organ transplant should be registered on the deceased donor waiting list
— However some registrants may proceed to living donor transplantation 
— Thereafter they’ll be removed from the waiting list

53.Fair and equitable system.
— (5) Access to organs, cells and tissues shall be provided without regard to recipient sex, age, religion, race, creed, color or financial standing
— What about nationality?

54.Transplantation activity.
— (1) The retrieval and preservation of human organs…
— Lets be consistent with terms used
— Internationally, the term used is “The procurement… of human organs”

— (5) When a person has been confirmed brain dead by the team in care, the Council shall immediately be notified to send an independent neurological team to confirm the death for purposes of donation. 
— This, again, only applies to deceased donor transplantation
— And this activity is not practical. An EEG is the standard way to define brain death and that can be electronically documented for the team at the local hospital. The patients relatives can review the evidence even without training (the local neurological team may explain the technical details)
— Family reserve the right to refuse to offer their loved ones body organs for transplantation

60.Preservation for transplantation
— (1) Where part of the body of a brain-dead person in a hospital, nursing home or other institution is or may be suitable for use for translation, the hospital, nursing home or institution shall preserve the body and transfer it to a designated transplant center for harvesting in accordance with this Act
— This may be prohibitively expensive. Typically a team of surgeons is sent to harvest the organs at the center where brain-death is declared. Only the organ is transported to the recipient hospital. This is cheaper and more cost-effective
— It is also logistically more meaningful since several organs may be procured from one deceased donor and the recipient hospitals for the various organs are unlikely to be the same since a waitlist is defined organ by organ

61.Harvesting of organs, tissues and cells
— Lets use the term procurement of organs
— National ID registration may be linked to organ donor status as done in the US

62.Retrieval procedure
— Lets be consistent
— Drop “harvesting”, “retrieval” from the entire bill
— Replace with “deceased donor organ procurement” throughout the document!
— With living donation the term used is “living donation” 
— Again, let the entire bill from the onset distinguish between these two modes of donation!

66.Recipient followup
— Absolutely key for performance metrics
— System should transfer followup medical records to the transplantation database

67.Donation and transplant of organs from living donors
— The distinction between living and deceased donors must be made at the outset
— Issues pertaining to these two modes are often very distinct
— Entire bill should reflect that 

PART IX.
78.Requirements for carrying out post-mortem 
— Unnecessary cost 
— Other means of assessing organ quality (i.e., donor risk index)

PART X.
— (3) Subject to the Constitution and Access to Information Act, 2005, information contained on the database may be made available to the public in a manner prescribed by regulations
— This is absolutely critical for transparency as well as outcomes research and quality control by third-parties as well as by regulators

XII.
93.Counseling of donors and recipients
— This is living donors
— Not applicable to deceased donors
— Reminder to distinguish the two

— jerk taco is my #1 goto for Jamaican
— very reliable quality, authenticity
— but horribly unreliable and inaccessible 
— no longer partner with door dash, grub hub or anyone
— sporadically closed on days they should be open
— officially never open on Sunday and monday
— testament to their quality: I’ve hang on despite… 


— would say something similar about savior west African food
— however, the oiliness of the food is intolerable
— perhaps my favorite west African restaurant yet
— more is the pity that I have to let them go
— just assess the quality of their food a day later when no hungry!
— likelihood that sheer hunger has thus far sustained my interest
— end this today

— food market remains my #1 restaurant overall
— professional chefs and best of western/european cuisine
— also best street tacos, better than any Mexican ones I’ve had!

#soul puff’d
#mind unsure
#body surely.. 

From 07/05/21

1.Art glorifies human errors
2.Does the realism of The Wire qualify as art?
3.We are seduced by flawed characters, especially the West Baltimore cast:
4.Omar, Snoopy, Senator Clay Davis, but also by the Police Department… 
5.So why, then, does season 5 fail? Why does McNutty seem contrived?
— It abandons reality
— Becomes intellectual
— Ultimately preachy
— Moral of story.. of the show becomes explicit
— Here we have the viewers intelligence greatly abused

Viewers can connects dots from the chaos of reality: 1-4?

Atheists are anything but aesthetes
They are moralists against religion
Better their reference than other

Vs.

Irreligiousness of Artists. — Homer is so much at home among his gods and is as a poet so good natured to them that he must have been profoundly irreligious. That which was brought to him by the popular faith — a mean, crude and partially repulsive superstition— he dealt with as freely as the Sculptor with his clay, therefore with the same freedom that Aeschylus and Aristophanes evinced and with which in later times the great artists of the renaissance, and also Shakespeare and Goethe, drew their pictures.

#relativity 

The physicists believe in a &quot;true world&quot; after their own kind; a fixed systematizing of atoms to perform necessary movements, and holding good equally of all creatures, so that, according to them, the &quot;world of appearance&quot; reduces itself to the side of general and generally-needed Being, which is accessible to every one according to his kind (accessible and also adjusted,—made &quot;subjective&quot;). But here they are in error. The atom which they postulate is arrived at by the logic of that perspective of consciousness; it is in itself therefore a subjective fiction. This picture of the world which they project is in no way essentially different from the subjective picture: the only difference is, that it is composed simply with more extended senses, but certainly with our senses.... And in the end, without knowing it, they left something out of the constellation: precisely the necessary perspective factor, by means of which every centre of power—and not man alone—constructs the rest of the world from its point of view—that is to say, measures it, feels it, and moulds it according to its degree of strength.... They forgot to reckon with this perspective-fixing power, in &quot;true being,&quot;—or, in school-terms, subject-being. They suppose that this was &quot;evolved&quot; and added;—but even the chemical investigator needs it: it is indeed specific Being, which determines action and reaction according to circumstances

googled: Turkish renaissance 
motive: quality of medical services, aviation, film

1.Live donor liver transplantation: Johns Hopkins sent Nabil Dagher to Turkey for a year for an apprenticeship

2.Turkish airlines: spokesmen and women are americas A-list celebrities including…

3.Another self: unremarkable Turkish limited series on Netflix. The quality of the cinematography and editing is world-class. But its really the dialogue that has moments that say something profound about the people, the nation.

### 

Turkey has witnessed sustained economic growth during the last ten years, with the country achieving average growth of 5% during 2002-2012, despite the fact that it is surrounded by neighbours facing political or economic crisis, representing a rather unstable external environment. Among its neighbours, Cyprus and Greece were deeply affected by the financial crisis that hit the Euro zone while Syria is being ravaged by civil war, and Iraq is unstable.  The latest demonstrations against the Turkish government’s plan to redevelop Gezi Park turned into nationwide protests, particularly by the youth, and constitute a warning message that the views of the youth of Turkey require serious consideration. An important fact that cannot be overlooked is that the youth movements in the region were the main antecedents for substantial revolutionary changes.

Despite the need for caution in assessing Turkey’s economic prospects for the coming years, the country’s success in achieving strong growth so far, amid regional instability, is worth contemplating. In fact, Turkey lacks natural resources such as oil and natural gas that neighboring countries have. However the country generated growth by focusing on enhancing industry, services and tourism, which helped boost its competitiveness. The tourism sector attracted more than 36 million tourists in 2012, rendering Turkey one of the top tourist destinations worldwide. However, this level of growth requires more than reliance on market forces and official development assistance. In order to obtain long-term benefits for growth and poverty alleviation, Turkey engaged in private sector development and structural reforms that enhanced its education and healthcare services, placed stricter controls on public finances and made progress towards combating corruption. Through effective support policies that promote financial resilience, investment, productivity growth and technological change, the country has integrated itself into the global economy and has become one of the major foreign direct investment (FDI) recipients in the Middle East region. (It was rated as the 13th most attractive FDI destination in the world in A.T. Kearney’s FDI Confidence Index 2012).

At the macro-level there is a modern infrastructure with highways and railways that link Ankara, the capital, with other parts of the country. To stimulate technological development, the country has been transformed into an important higher education hub that attracts an increasing number of university students from Asia and Africa. Effective university-industry collaboration has contributed to providing domestic industry with its needs in important fields, including aeronautical technology, IT and electronics. The country has invested heavily in technology development zones with 34 operational technoparks and 16 under construction to support research and development activities and attract investment into high technology fields. Turkey has focused on environmental technology aimed at generating sustainable energy that benefits from wind and other renewable energy resources, enabling it to compete globally in innovative green technologies and products. Furthermore, the country has succeeded in solid waste management, turning Ankara into a safer and greener place to live. Methanol gas and organic waste are used to generate electricity and to produce fertilizers for agricultural products, including strawberries, tomatoes and orchids.

Turkey’s trade and investment strategy is based upon a strategic ‘opening up’ to emerging markets in Asia and Africa and the Middle East, with low entry barriers. Turkey benefits from a Customs Union agreement with the EU, and free trade agreements with several countries including EFTA ( European Free Trade Association) member countries Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, and also Egypt, Jordan, Morocco, Palestine, Syria, and Tunisia. This has contributed to growth and increased productivity in both the industrial and services sectors, including green technology and IT.

These achievements would not have been possible without the strong political will of the policy-makers to attain a turnaround in Turkey’s economy and move forward with its EU accession process. They embarked on an incremental process of institutional building and reforms that started in 2003 and aimed at addressing Turkey’s structural problems. The reforms had a positive impact on the banking sector, the management and control of the public budget, and directing domestic investment towards infrastructure, health, education and technology.  In the field of education, concerted efforts by the government and education institutions aim to bridge the gender gap and enhance the quality of education and higher education.

A consistent and incremental path of institutional reforms has led to robust economic growth, increased resilience to the global economic crisis and a remarkable surge in exports, reaching $153 billion by the end of 2012, up from $36 billion in 2002.  Most notably, Turkey was registered on the world economic scale as the 16th largest economy in the world, and as 6th largest economy when compared to EU countries in 2012.
Turkey’s remarkable achievements show that facing the challenge of enhancing international competitiveness and achieving sustainable growth could be met by combining national support policies for investment, productivity growth, and technological change (based in high value-added sectors) with emerging opportunities in the global economy. That is not to say that Turkey has developed a policy for development that can be replicated everywhere. Any process of reform and private sector development MUST take into account the large differences amongst countries and their individual, unique characteristics. Nevertheless, general policies could be considered – as common features among countries do exist – especially where these can be translated into country-specific policies.

Like a modern day Homer 
Has too many war stories to share 
Simply no room for backstories 
Except what might be surmised 
From dialogues strewn throughout 

Breaking bad also has none of this 
It’s Sopranos &amp; Madmen 
That suffer from this fault 
With their Freudian formulae 
On which all stands or falls 

Freud is a metaphysician 
And so anything built on 
Psychoanalytic formulae

<p>09/12/22</p>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>I have got a few questions since Friday, on how to calculate <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(\Delta = 1)\)</span> in HW1, so I am sending out a hint. Use the following formula (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(C\)</span> are random variables, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(t\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(c\)</span> are dummy variables, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\int_{a}^{b}\)</span> means integrating from <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span> to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(b\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f_T\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(f_C\)</span> are the pdfs):</p>
<p>$<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(
P(\Delta = 1)  =  P(T&lt;= C)  =  \int_{0}^{ub}  \int_{0}^c  f_T(t) \times f_C(c) dt dc
\)</span>$.</p>
<p>Note that the outer (first) integral is with respect to c, and the inner integral is with respect to t.</p>
<p>I won’t be able to cover this in class further, but I found this thread of discussion providing some details/insights:</p>

1.Wikipedia reduces it to “identity” (aka being)
— Don Drapers fake identity 
— Selling products with fake identity
— Unfaithfulness and fake marital identity
— Being a woman, black, etc. and the identity that comes from social rank
— This is all metaphysical BS

2.I say as follows:
— Peggy Olson becomes
— Starts off as a fledgling, not-so-pretty, mere secretary, who has been shit upon
— But she is never resentful (i.e., is not a victim, but an willful agent like any of the men/bosses/masters)
— Only gets stronger, harder, faster, prettier, more powerful, more desirable, more impressive

3.Art rightfully replaces morality as the metaphysical activity of life
— In review #1 above morality is the undertone (i.e., the mores of the 1960s)
— Even the creator of the show thinks this way
— Yet in review #2 art, insofar as this show depicts the aesthetic phenomenon of becoming, is overtone
— Worth noting that the creator doesn’t see it this way

4.Flashbacks and backstories
— This attempt to explain being
— Why is this character like so and so?
— Oh, look to their childhood! Freud and such shit!!!
— And that’s why Don Draper is only interesting in the first two episodes of season 1
— He is a strange mysterious figure, ambitious, but alas already a genius at work
— Now, when the flashbacks and backstories unveil his being its all downhill from here
— Similar decadence in the quality of writing cross-talks to Peggy Olson
— Now we know where she comes from and what happened to her child
— Then there’s the priest who gets into her grill and starts to preach about sin and eternal damnation

5.How does Mad men pull it off?
— I guess its the honest writers
— They are honestly metaphysical and moral
— But also at times honestly awed by becoming
— And so its all in there, as it is in life!!!

Khaby Lame, the Fresh Prince of TikTok, Is Launching His First Collection With Boss

With almost 141million followers on TikTok and just over 78 million more on Instagram, Khaby Lame is one of the most followed social media stars in the world. And how has the 22-year-old Italian achieved this? Chiefly through silently satirizing the ridiculous content that other people post in order to become more followed on social media. Now that really is meta.

“The funniest part of my content is the silence,” said Lame over WhatsApp yesterday: “Silent comedy speaks a language that everybody in the world can understand.” By doing in the digital age what Charlie Chaplin, Harold Lloyd, and Buster Keaton once did during the dawn of cinema, Lame has gone from unemployed factory worker (he started posting after being laid off at the start of the pandemic) to a man who rubs shoulders with global icons like Leo Messi: “Meeting him is one thing I still can’t believe happened.”

From 6 pm tonight in San Babila, Milan, Lame will launch his first-ever capsule collection with Boss before throwing a party later at the city’s most famous nightspot, Plastic, so his locally based fans will have the chance to see him IRL. “There will be a giant Khaby,” said Lame. “We will take Polaroid pictures. I will arrive on a scooter flanked by a team of BMX riders wearing the collection. It’ll be amazing!” Doubtless many more will check in via their screens too. Lame says that around 15% of his audience is from Italy, 25 % is from South America, and 30% is from the US*.

The Boss x Khaby collection is a tight ensemble including varsity jacket and hoodie. One surprising inclusion—and the reason for that ‘giant Khaby’ promised at the reveal later—is a Khaby doll designed to be used as an accessory or an attachment that can be snapped onto the garments. Huh? Lame explained: “When I was a kid I had an action figure of Vegeta from Dragon Ball and I’ve been collecting action figures for years. I’m really passionate about action figures and anime characters. And now to see that there is a doll of myself and there will be an event to launch it along with the collection… I’m super excited.” Lame&#39;s capsule will be on sale exclusively in Boss’s San Babila store today before going on global release tomorrow.

As well as pumping out content with his team every day, and thinking through his next capsule—“I definitely want to do another one”—Lame is also focused on learning English and plotting his future moves. He said: “I want to be an actor, like Will Smith. He started with comedy, then he made more dramatic movies. He’s done all sorts of films, he’s a great actor and I would like to be like him. In fact my passion for acting started with him, watching him in The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Watching that show, I realized that I also wanted to make people laugh.” Lame is certainly doing that on social. And with that 200 million-plus audience already behind him it seems a no-brainer that we’ll see him on bigger screens soon enough.

He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at

Cassius (metaphorical)
No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,
And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.

Casca (prosaic)
I know not what you mean by that, but I am sure

09/25/22

Pyrrhus was preparing to launch an invasion of the Italian peninsula at great cost to both gold and life. Over a philosophical dinner Cineas asked the king, “Once you have beaten the Romans what shall we do?”
 
   “Once the Romans are conquered we shall have all the riches of Italy at our disposal,” Pyrrhus answered.
 
   Cineas paused, probably sipped from his wine and asked, “And what will we do then?”
   Sicily is near! It will be an easy victory.”
   Cineas thought a moment more. ”And then what shall we do?”
   &quot;Then we will take Libya and Carthage,” the king replied.
   &quot;What will we do after that?”
   &quot;We will secure all of the Greek world under my rule,” the king nodded at the thought.
   “But what will we do then?” Cineas asked.
   “Ah, my friend,” said Pyrrhus, ”then we shall rest. We will drink wine, and talk philosophy, and enjoy the fruits of our friendship.”
 
Cineas looked around. They had wine. They had friendship. They were talking. “Can’t we do what you wish now without harming anyone with war or causing pain to ourselves?”
 
Pyrrhus’s reply is not recorded. The war went ahead. He died in one of his battles when a tile was thrown from a roof by an enemy woman, smashing his skull. Such accidents rarely happen in dining rooms, so the king would probably have done well to listen to his Epicurean friend and perhaps enjoyed the quieter life of the contemplative thinker.

<li><p>Fixed in identity, i.e., regardless of time (e.g., oh ancient of days!)</p></li>
<li><p>The issue of which yields most desired outcome</p></li>
</ol>
<p>But even desire is subject to metaphysics:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Agency (e.g., truthfulness)</p></li>
<li><p>Ends (e.g., paradise)</p></li>
<li><p>Passivity (i.e., life) <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id34" id="id18">32</a></p></li>
</ol>
<p>However, in the end it is a question of “what then”?</p>

— meta-analysis of

— causal inference methods double-down on

— neglects epistemological (e.g. latent phenotypes)

— over-time and within an ecosystem agents, verbs &amp; objects

— variance in a cross-section of time

09/29/22

Pepe-Flemings is the right p-value for KM survival curves; 
log-rank only appropriate if you’ve plotted hazard function
and demonstrated non-cross-over of hazard functions!!!!!!

Ordering of hazards is preserved through integration of hazards
Thus survival functions are also ordered
But going the other way doesn’t imply nicely ordered hazard function

Cumulative hazard may remain ordered yet the hazards cross-over a bit, later on
Here we have the intuition as to why ordered survival may not translate into ordered hazards
So we’ve been abusing the log-rank test in virtually all publications

*by looking at NHANES we’ve revealed that donors, though healthier than average, have increased risk —&gt; AR
*first mortality, then ESRD, now we wish to go further upstream before ESRD (e.g. CKD, CVD, hospitalization, frailty)
*with older NHANES we don’t have great longitudinal data for our upstream interests
*here’s where NHATS comes to mind with caveats…
*there is no longitudinal older donor followup. At best cross-sections during hospitalization events… 

1.Healthy older non-donors
2.Incidence of hospitalizations (ICD-9/10)
3.Trajectories of frailty 
4.Cross-sections of donor hospitalizations 
5.Footprint of missing data: see Macey 

In that case, let’s meet in my office at COAH: 2024 E Monument St, Suite 2-700, room 710. See you then!

— disability trajectories: ADL, IADL, frailty, etc.
— cms-linked restricted file for ESRD: my access? IRB, 
— incidence of hospitalizations and associated ICD codes!!!!
*
— guide my cross-sectional donor analyses
— maybe cross-sectional comparisons
— unlikely to have disability collected in donors
— but will use text review of medical records… length of hospitalization, rehospitalization, etc.
*
— also pilots for R03/R21?

*

Physical, cognitive functional trajectories, but not blood work… 
2 and half hours at home… 
SBBP, cognitive battery, hearing and vision, etc.
Hospitalization, CMS (free linkage).. next c
ACJMEN
*demographicas can be linked with medical claims

              If he kicks, he&#39;ll be a soccer player.

              If he screams, a mariachi.

              And if he laughs, he&#39;ll be a homo.

<p>Sparta was frequently a subject of fascination in its own day, as well as in Western culture following the revival of classical learning. The admiration of Sparta is known as Laconophilia. Bertrand Russell wrote:</p>
<p>Sparta had a double effect on Greek thought: through the reality, and through the myth…. The reality enabled the Spartans to defeat Athens in war; the myth influenced Plato’s political theory, and that of countless subsequent writers…. [The] ideals that it favors had a great part in framing the doctrines of Rousseau, Nietzsche, and National Socialism</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Duncan?</p>
<p>10/12/22</p>
<p>Spartan boys were expected to take an older male mentor, usually an unmarried young man. According to some sources, the older man was expected to function as a kind of substitute father and role model to his junior partner; however, others believe it was reasonably certain that they had sexual relations (the exact nature of Spartan pederasty is not entirely clear). Xenophon, an admirer of the Spartan educational system whose sons attended the agoge, explicitly denies the sexual nature of the relationship.</p>

10/22/22

Let’s make a night to remember 2:55/4:33
Have you ever really loved a woman? Hahahaha

Bryan Adams has been a vegan for 32 years; he quit eating meat and dairy in 1989.[352] He relayed his experiences with his plant-based diet in an interview with Vegan Life Magazine in 2016:

For those people who aren&#39;t veggie or vegan it was the best gift I could ever give myself to do it. I am turning 57 years old this year and I work hard, I am always on the move but I have tons of energy because I am plant-based. It is absolutely the best thing you could ever do for yourself. It is a great path.[353]

Adams has never married. In the 1990s, he was in a relationship with Danish model Cecilie Thomsen.[354] Adams and Alicia Grimaldi, his former personal assistant and now trustee and co-founder of his namesake foundation, had their first daughter in April 2011 and their second daughter in February 2013.[355] His parents are British, and one grandmother was born in Malta.[356] Adams has homes in London[20] and Paris.[357]
On October 30, 2021, Adams cancelled his participation in a tribute to singer Tina Turner, just before the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame ceremony, after testing positive for COVID-19.[358] On November 25, 2021, Adams tested positive for COVID-19 for the second time, and was placed in a hotel for a two week quarantine in Italy

Unfortunately, these platitudes are meaningless

They’ll not make a convert of this fella ☝🏾

Uniting the country? That’s what I was reacting to. Folks from larger previously dominant tribes are threatened by unity. Things can only get “worse” for them as the “United Nations” take their country from them

We see it with the Baganda and Wazungu in America, UK, Sweden, Spain, Italy, France, etc

Also, and this is a question for P, as father, Christian, and educator: when one talks of family values, education, and raising our children, aren’t all these things at war with each other?

I say this as a product of all the above:

1.Church of Uganda did its job in childhood 

2.Boarding school did its job in teenage

3.Wider world has done its job in early adulthood 

4.And family has been the accompanying bass through out

5.Then science, philosophy, arts have proved to be disrupters of everything that’s I’ve been taught since childhood as “valuable”

So to me family values compete with education. They don’t complement each other. It’s the whole mess of boarding school and the various influences it brings. Is it the point to shield onself from outside influence? If so, then why not just remain at home instead of school?

Food for thought

And Ps responses especially desired since he is national leader in education, ministry, family, counseling :)

One last thing, with the ascendency of Indian culture in the UK (curry, kebab now not Fish &amp; chicken and plum pudding), and the already eminent decline of the Church of England, Hindu May emerge as a source of values

Is a Christian to welcome these changes and trends?

This is the world my nieces and nephews are going to face as they seek further education and career opportunities beyond Kampala

Patrick Muinda at 15:32 on 10/26/22

D, thanks for asking.

When done as God teaches us in His Word, family values and Education actually complement each other. They are by no means at war with each other when done as taught by God in His Word.

Let&#39;s examine the facts in scripture:

Exodus 20:12 (The First family value, given as a command AND the only command in scripture with a promise)

Regard (treat with honor, due obedience, and courtesy) your father and mother, that your days may be long in the land the Lord your God gives you. A promise of long life!! ...as a desirable outcome of family values. Education alone cannot pull off long life. We&#39;ve seen Proffessors cut their lives short by simply not living according to God&#39;sWord.

2 Timothy 3:15 says, you took in the sacred Scriptures with your mother&#39;s milk as she taught you Godly, damily values! There&#39;s nothing like the written Word of God for showing you the way to salvation, and success in this life through faith in Christ Jesus. (...added emphasis).

This too applies to formal education. As you study scripture to add to your knowledge of God and His will, we too ought to have a formal education to add to our knowledge of life in this world.

Jesus prayed for us when He said in John 17:15-16 My prayer is not that you take them out of the world but that you protect them from the evil one. They are not of the world, even as I am not of it.

On the flip side, having Godly family values will keep you away from evil. Education does not even attempt to do likewise. If anything, education could draw you into science that instead draws you away from God.

The Apostle Peter exhorted believers to “make every effort to add to your faith goodness; and to goodness, knowledge, and to knowledge, self control” (2 Peter 1:6).

When you couple this with the family values enshrined in honoring your father and mother, it will go well with you in the land God has given you...even your education and it&#39;s outcome thereof.

Finally, being a wholesome Christian who is educated and yet is established in Godly family values, the outcome is the creation of an environment of respect for God, for His Word and for authority. It will lay foundations of discipline, moral values and a work ethic that will prepare a student for life. That student will grow into such a pullar in society because He is well anchored in God&#39;s Word with education and solid family values.

I submit. God be with you.

P.

11/01/22

1.Approved research plan
— why over 2-4y period?
— several reasons
— considered original timeline too ambitious (both GTPCI and NIA reviewers!)
— following recommendations, I extended out my plans for an additional 2 years

2. Since then
— scheduled and passed my PoE
— have secured most of the data I’ll need (corresponding to 1-3)
— my immediate next steps are curating analytic datasets
— exploratory analyses and reporting preliminary findings
— iterations and feedback from you

3.Goal is to be at stage for thesis draft, defense, and publication by may/2023
— ambitious as advisory committee says
— but will give it a try
— still have some advanced courses to complete
— one in each term.. 

4.any questions???
— thesis research documentation 
— due academic registers office on 11/26
— finalize this in next two weeks
 

—&gt; Fabian not available in first week of May 2023

Hi Fabian,
 
Looking forward to a brief discussion of my thesis plans with you and two other advisory members. I’ve attached a brief outline of what I presented for my preliminary oral exam. And have also attached the approved research plan. 
 
Here’s my update:
 
1. Research plan &amp; timeline approved by the GTPCI advisory committee
2. Since approval I’ve completed 1-3 of 9 tasks
3. On course to complete 4-6 over next two months
4. Next scheduled Thesis advisory committee meeting ~ 05/23
5. Aiming to have completed 1-6 and possibly 7 by then
 
Thanks,
 
Abi

Fully of vexation come I

http://shakespeare.mit.edu/midsummer/midsummer.1.1.html

Full of vexation come I, with complaint
Against my child, my daughter Hermia.
Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,
This man hath my consent to marry her.
Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,
This man hath bewitch&#39;d the bosom of my child;
Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
And interchanged love-tokens with my child:
Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
With feigning voice verses of feigning love,
And stolen the impression of her fantasy
With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,
Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers
Of strong prevailment in unharden&#39;d youth:
With cunning hast thou filch&#39;d my daughter&#39;s heart,
Turn&#39;d her obedience, which is due to me,
To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,
Be it so she; will not here before your grace
Consent to marry with Demetrius,
I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,
As she is mine, I may dispose of her:
Which shall be either to this gentleman
Or to her death, according to our law
Immediately provided in that case.

<p><strong>Yours truly:</strong> reasonable null hypothesis for a philibaster in senate?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong><br />
Apologies for the confusion, but there seems to be a misunderstanding. The provided Python code correctly calculates a 95% confidence interval around a proportion, and the output should not exceed the range of 0 to 1, as a proportion is a percentage and cannot exceed 100% or be less than 0%.</p>
<p>When you calculate the standard error and the confidence interval with the given values (p=0.51, n=100), the result will fall within this range. If you’re obtaining a value of 60, it suggests a potential issue with the calculation or an error in the code’s execution.</p>
<p>Let’s do a quick check on the calculation:</p>
<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>
```python
import math

# given variables
p = 0.51
n = 100

# calculate standard error (se)
se = math.sqrt(p * (1 - p) / n)

# calculate the 95% confidence interval
ci_low = p - 1.96 * se
ci_high = p + 1.96 * se

print(f&quot;p: {p}&quot;)
print(f&quot;se: {se}&quot;)
print(f&quot;95% confidence interval: ({ci_low}, {ci_high})&quot;)

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>With the above code, the output should be something similar to:</p>
<div class="highlight-yaml notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nt">p</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">0.51</span>
<span class="nt">se</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">0.04998999899979995</span>
<span class="nt">95% confidence interval</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="l l-Scalar l-Scalar-Plain">(0.41202664796364, 0.60797335203636)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The confidence interval falls between roughly 0.41 and 0.61, which are reasonable bounds for a confidence interval around the proportion 0.51. This is consistent with the expected range (0-1) for a proportion.</p>
<p><strong>Yours truly:</strong> so for the US senate that has 100 members (n=100), doesn’t a null hypothesis (p=.51 for a razor-thin senate majority) give us an upper bound of 60? Which is the philibaster number?</p>
<p><strong>Yours truly:</strong>  Apologies for the earlier confusion, but I understand your point now. You are not looking at the proportion as a percentage between 0 and 1, but you’re looking at it as the actual number of senators (out of 100). When you calculate the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval with p=0.51 and n=100, you’re looking at the potential number of senators who might support a bill, not a percentage.</p>

<p>This will give you the range of senators (out of 100) who might support a bill with 95% confidence. The upper bound should indeed be around 60 senators, which is the threshold number for breaking a filibuster in the Senate.</p>
<p>Note: We’re assuming here that the true proportion of supporting senators in the population is 0.51, and we’re calculating a confidence interval around that proportion. The calculation doesn’t directly address the chance of a filibuster or its success. It’s just a measure of statistical uncertainty around the estimate of supporting senators.</p>
<p><strong>Yours truly:</strong>  any evidence that this is the logic behind the “magical” 60?</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT:</strong> The “magical” 60, as it relates to the United States Senate, refers to the number of votes required to invoke cloture and end a filibuster, or extended debate that blocks legislative action. This number is not directly linked to statistical analyses or confidence intervals, but instead, it is a procedural rule set by the Senate.</p>
<p>The reason why 60 votes are needed to end a filibuster is due to Rule XXII of the Senate, often called the “cloture rule”. This rule was adopted in 1917 in response to the tactics of obstructionists, particularly during debate over America’s entry into World War I. Originally, two-thirds of senators present and voting were required to invoke cloture; this was changed to three-fifths of all senators (normally 60 out of 100) in a 1975 amendment to the rule.</p>
<p>In practice, the 60 vote rule means that, while a simple majority (51 votes) is required to pass most legislation, a supermajority (60 votes) is required to end debate and bring the legislation to a vote. This gives substantial power to minority factions within the Senate, as they can block legislation unless a compromise can be reached that convinces enough senators to invoke cloture.</p>
<p>While it’s an interesting observation that the upper range of a 95% confidence interval around a slim majority (0.51) in a 100-member Senate is near 60, it’s likely coincidental and not the direct reasoning behind the procedural rule. The rule is more about facilitating debate and requiring a larger consensus to move forward with legislation.</p>

On June 13, 2018, the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) retracted the 2013 study, “Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular Diseases with a Mediterranean Diet


*

PART A

Estruch et al for the PREDIMED Study Investigators. Primary prevention of cardiovascular disease with a Mediterranean diet. NEJM 2013

A systematic review and meta-analysis of 5087 randomized, controlled trials published in general medical journals was conducted by a meticulous defender of science, Carlisle JB, in 2017 (1). Carlislse found data fabrication and other reasons for non-random sampling in several of these studies, including Estruch et al for the PREDIMED Study Investigators. Primary prevention of cardiovascular disease with a Mediterranean diet. NEJM 2013 (2). This latter study is my choice for Part A of this weeks activity.

Table 1 in this very highly cited study demonstrated differences between baseline study and control populations characteristics that were substantially different from what would have been expected to result from randomization. A year later in 2018, the study authors in collaboration with the NEJM editors retracted the original 2013 study and published a revised analysis that addressed the sampling errors that had been identified (3). As such, the source of error here is methodological (i.e., research design was complex; this increased the number of protocol items, processes, and likelihood of human error).

Estruch et al and PREDIMED conducted a review of how participants were assigned to various interventions groups. This effort revealed irregularities in their randomization procedures. As honest and responsible scientists, they withdrew the original report and published a new one. It is worth noting that once corrected the protocol deviations did not result in any significant change in estimates and inferences from the study, consistent with what one would expect from small random error from a very large study. To date, the original, retracted study has been cited close to 6000 times whereas the corrected one has been cited about 2000 times.

I read the original study when it was published in 2013 and its only because of this weeks assignment that I’ve learned about the retraction — pure chance!!!


PART B

As described by the authors in their original study, the PREDIMED trial was a parallel-group, multcenter, randomized trial (2). 7447 participants from Europe, Central or South America, and other countries across the world were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three dietary intervention groups across. 

Was the randomization process performed at the individual level (i.e., 7447 independently sampled persons)? No, since the study included members from the same households, 11 study sites (i.e., intra-site correlations in statistical analysis), and in general inconsistent use of randomization procedures at some sites (4).

The revised analyses corrected the statistical correlations within families and clinics, omitted 1588 participants whose trial-group assignments were unknown or suspected to have departed from protocol, and estimates and p-values recalculated. 

Despite these revelations no significant change in the results was observed. As mentioned earlier, this is somewhat consistent with the nature of errors arising randomly as contrasted with those arising systematically — as discussed in part A. That said, the discovery of these random errors highlights a self-correcting aspect already intrinsic to science, namely the systematic review and meta-analysis of already published works. 

No recommendations will change the activity of the kind of welcome vigilantism demonstrated by Carlisle. One sees that its quite remarkable that Carlisle approached the issue from a purely statistical perspective and had an impact at the very highest tiers of pier review, the New England Journal of Medicine, and in a field of expertise (nutrition) that they may not have had any particular interest in! One also sees how responsive and responsible the authors Estruch et al were. And so this entire retraction story is quite reassuring in terms of the prospects of science or its current status. 

However, I wish to recommend one other consideration. That we restore the old practice of reporting p-values in Table 1 of randomized trials, to demonstrate balance across trial arms. It used to be a standard practice across journals until p-values became unfashionable in certain high circles. 

Also, I recommend that we restore the practice of using a flow chart to describe the sampling design of study participants. Such a chart as Figure 1 may have highlighted to reviewers and readers the sampling error committed by the authors and this might have been addressed in the peer-review period or in an editorial as early as 2013.

Apropos of nothing 

Being your slave, what should I do but tendUpon the hours and times of your desire?I have no precious time at all to spend,Nor services to do, till you require.Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hourWhilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,Nor think the bitterness of absence sourWhen you have bid your servant once adieu;Nor dare I question with my jealous thoughtWhere you may be, or your affairs suppose,But, like a sad slave, stay and think of noughtSave, where you are how happy you make those.
So true a fool is love that in your will,Though you do any thing, he thinks no ill

Hon. GAD K. GASAATURA Presents This Paper For Discussion:

In the recent past, some people, led by one Mr. Frank Gashumba, proposed that Banyarwanda of Uganda, as enshrined in the Constitution, be renamed &#39;Abavandimwe&#39;, (meaning &#39;brethren&#39;, of one womb/ mother). Such a move, they aver, will put an end to the discrimination, harassment and victimisation that Banyarwanda continue to be subjected to.
This presumes that the cause of discrimination is due to the obvious connotation in the word &#39;Banyarwanda&#39;, which might seem to connect them to Rwanda.
The proposal met with much bewilderment and consternation especially among Banyarwanda - both within and without the confines of Uganda..! It was widely rejected.

This article seeks to examine the issues raised in the said proposal.
Team Gashumba presents TWO ISSUES. And I will examine them within Two perspectives - The African Context &amp; The Global Perspective:

The Main Issues Raised:
i) Many Banyarwanda of Uganda, are frustrated. Almost at every turn, they suffer much discrimination, and are treated as not being fully Ugandan; they often have to explain themselves as to why, if they are Banyarwanda, they do not want to go &#39;back home&#39; - to Rwanda!
Consequently, many complain of being denied Uganda Passports, jobs, promotions and other services and opportunities ordinarily available to other citizens.
==========
As I will argue,
FEW BANYARWANDA WOULD DISAGREE WITH THE COMPLAINT.
==========

ii) In view of the above, Team Gashumba proposes that Banyarwanda of Uganda be Re-named &#39;Abavandimwe&#39;, to avoid being mistaken for Banyarwanda of Rwanda (Rwandans).
==========
While most will agree with the problem so identified:
FEW BANYARWANDA WOULD AGREE WITH THE PROPOSAL.. - to change their identity..!
==========

I will also introduce two perspectives:
iii) The AFRICAN CONTEXT - The Legacy of Colonial Boundaries:

iv) The GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE On Ethnic Rivalry &amp; Conflict - Are We Alone..?
===================

TEAM GASHUMBA CONCERNS:

i) Are there Native Banyarwanda citizens of Uganda?

Refer to Population Census records in Uganda, starting in 1911; then 1921, 1931; 1948, then 1959 - before the influx of Refugees fro Rwanda, and 1969.
In all these Population Counts, Banyarwanda consistently turned out between 6% and 7% of the population, making it 6th or 7th largest ethnic group in Uganda, most of them in Buganda, Kigezi and Ankole.
Needless to say, There are, indeed, BANYARWANDA of UGANDA, equal citizens with the rest, who need not explain themselves more than is reasonable or as required of others.

As at 1893, there was no entity called Uganda. In present day western Uganda, there were several disparate Chiefdoms and Kingdoms, such as Mpororo, Nkore, Tooro &amp; Bunyoro, which, in peace or in war, had close relations with other neighbouring kingdoms of Rwanda, Karagwe, Kooki, Buganda among others. Consequently, their respective people&#39;s would move across borders, to flee conflict or in search of opportunities.

In 1894, the British procured the first consent for &#39;British Protection&#39; from Buganda. Other territories were subsequently added - Ankole, Tooro, Bunyoro etc. to form the &#39;Uganda British Protectorate&#39; - until Independence in 1962.

The very first Constitution - The 1962 (Lancaster negotiated) Independence Constitution of Uganda established the &#39;Persons to become citizens of Uganda, on 9th October 1962.
It covers most Banyarwanda in Uganda.
============

1962: UGANDA INDEPENDENCE CONSTITUTION:

CHAPTER II: CITIZENSHIP 7(1):
&quot;Every person who, having been born in Uganda, is on 8th October 1962 a  citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies or a British protected person, shall become a citizen of Uganda on 9th October 1962:
 - &quot;Provided that person shall not become a citizen of Uganda by virtue of this subsection, if neither of his parents was born in Uganda.&quot;

1995: UGANDA CONSTITUTION:

CHAPTER 3: CITIZENSHIP 9.
Citizens of Uganda:
&quot;Every person who, on the commencement of this Constitution, is a citizen of Uganda shall continue to be such a citizen.

The several categories of Banyarwanda in Uganda have been articulated elsewhere - including:
- Those who were &#39;bordered/ fenced-in&#39; by the new Colonial Borders of Uganda;
- The various migrations, before and after 1926 up to 1959;
- Refugees
- Other Migrant workers

If I may speak for most of my compatriots originally from areas bordering Rwanda -
- The Greater Kigezi and Greater Ankole, many of our fathers, grandfathers or close relatives were enlisted and served under the King&#39;s African Rifles (KAR); Others served under the Kingdom Offices, Others were good Tax payers etc. Our parents, grandparents and those among us who were alive, were indeed and truly &quot;British Protected Persons&quot;, on 8th October, 1962, who became citizens on the 9th October 1962.

My own maternal grandfather, AZARIYA KANYAMIBWA, was present, at the Kamwezi signing of the Protocol between Great Britain and Germany, Describing the Frontier between the Uganda Protectorate and German East Africa, Signed at Kamwezi in 1911.
He was also one of the Local Officials who accompanied the Enganzi (Primier) of Ankole, NUWA MBAGUTA, together with Europeans, in the demarcation of the Uganda/ Rwanda border. But my family was not alone in the border area; until 1960s, Banyarwanda made up a majority along the Rwanda border.

Notwithstanding the obvious explanations, however, reports and complaints abound, of harassment and discrimination that Banyarwanda in Uganda continue to suffer, especially when they need to access public services. It is wrong, to regularly require greater proof of citizenship, for instance, from members of one particular ethnic community than is asked of others.

ii) SHOULD BANYARWANDA of UGANDA CHANGE NAME?
.
As has been stated elsewhere by many Banyarwanda, the suggestion is not only uninformed, it is unreasonable and ridiculous:
- It is uninformed, because most of the offenders do it out of malice; It would only be fair to expect them still to continue in their &#39;ill will&#39; machinations against the Banyarwanda community, no matter the name.
Many still recall the &#39;Ethnic Cleansing&#39; of 1982, in which more than 100,000 Banyarwanda were expelled by the UPC Government and UPC functionaries, especially from &#39;Greater Ankole..!&#39; Citizens were forced into Refugee Camps in Uganda, while others were driven across the border into Rwanda - only to die in thousands, in poorly managed refugee camps.

Among those expelled, were thousands who had completely assimilated into other communities, who could no longer speak or comprehend The Kinyarwanda language. To many who witnessed the treachery of neighbour against neighbour, in Communities and would-be Places of Refuge, the Churches, the &#39;Name Change&#39; suggestion just comes as a &#39;Bad Joke..!&#39;

Yes, the suggestion is ridiculous, because the Banyarwanda is a nation of people, spread across the East and Central African states, and around the world; they are native in the D.R.Congo, in Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda; Kinyarwanda/ Kirundi is probably third most widely spoken language in Africa - after Arabic and Swahili; sizable populations of Banyarwanda has also grown in other parts of Africa, Europe and the Americas.
Banyarwanda are a Nation of people, scattered by circumstances throughout the world, but whose Culture is a great source of Strength to be sought - not to be shunned..!! There&#39;re many people groups that would &#39;kill to be allowed into&#39; such a MILLENIUM-OLD kith and kin association.

Just to demonstrate one element of this Community Strength that many members will already be familiar with - &quot;GUSHUMBUSH&#39; INKA&quot;:

The Banyarwanda Culture compels community members &#39;Kugir&#39; UBUNTU n&#39; UBUPFURA..!!&#39;
(To be kind-hearted and considerate of others);
Custom requires one to be mindful of one&#39;s neighbour&#39;s dire needs; your neighbour is to be treated as your own brother, whose nakedness, hunger or want becomes your own nakedness and shame..! Others will think you less, if you do not reach out..! So powerful and compelling..!
If, for instance, your neighbour or relative fell on hard times - lost most of his (cattle) wealth, his fault or not, it becomes your duty to work it out with him and others, as to how best to quickly cover his shame and need - to keep that man&#39;s, and community dignity.
Banyarwanda would give him cows - to be returned after 3 to 7 years or much longer, when the man has been able to get back on his &#39;feet&#39; - &quot;KWITURA&quot;.

This, to the envy of many.., protesting:
          .... &quot;KWONK&#39; ABANYARWANDA NIMUKUNDANA..!

                   ..... &quot;NAYE KALE, ABANYALWANDA MWAGALANA..!

Is this a culture and name to abandon and to shun? 
I say, NO..!

TUR&#39; ABANYARWANDA;
TUR&#39; ABAVANDIMWE;
TUR&#39; IMFURA Z&#39;ABADAHEMUKA..!!

iii) THE AFRICA CONTEXT - The Legacy of Arbitrary Colonial Boundaries:
On all borders of Uganda, as oft the case for most African countries, one finds communities that were separated by The Arbitrary &#39;Pen of The 1884/85 Berlin Conference&#39;, wherein the European Powers greedily partitioned and distributed the African lands among themselves - like hyenas on the weakened buffalo..!
Already, Communities were also often found straddled across recognised frontiers of pre-colonial kingdoms. People would move to flee conflict or in search of food and pasture.

With the Partition of Africa - Uganda, like most other African colonies, was handed artificial border lines that literally split families and communities apart..!
In Kenya, they had to contend with the question of &#39;KENYAN SOMALI&#39; natives of Northern Kenya. In Angola, they have a large native population of &#39;BAKONGO&#39; - same people as those in Congo (DRC) and in the other Congo Republic; In South Africa, there&#39;s a native &#39;SOTHO Tribe&#39; - kinsmen to the people of LESOTHO. SO WE ARE NOT ALONE..!

Similarly in UGANDA: We have, at our borders, the same populations as the neighbouring countries. Kenya and Uganda share several ethnic communities: Samia, Bakusu/ Bagisu, Iteso etc.

There was an interesting story in The Daily Nation of Kenya recently:

&quot;A Tale of Two UGANDA Kings Who Hold Big Sway In Kenya Politics:
Cultural kings are recognised in the Ugandan Constitution — not in Kenya — but traditional powers bestowed upon two kings in Eastern Uganda spill over to Kenya.
One King, of the Bamasaba brings together the Bagisu of Uganda and Bukusu of Kenya of a common ancestry, King Wamimbi; and the King of the Itesos of Kenya and Uganda, His Highness Papa Emormor; Both have commanding respect among their subjects inside Uganda and Kenya.
In the last Kenya elections, a Ugandan cultural king was implored to intervene and strike a truce between two senior political leaders who were at loggerheads in Western Kenya - Ministers Moses Wetang’ula (Trade) and Eugene Wamalwa (Justice and Constitutional Affairs), both from the Bukusu community, were key pillars for Cord and Jubilee coalition campaigns in the region.
“I was approached by some leaders from Kenya to reconcile the two politicians..,” Bamasaba King  Wilson Wamimbi (Omukuka)  told The Standard on Sunday in an interview at his Busano home near Mbale town, Eastern Uganda.
But perhaps the most dramatic case to demonstrate the travesty served the African communities, is that of the renowned Awori family - also on the Kenya border.
The Tale of two Awori Brothers:
MOODY AWORI (b. 1928-) was the 9th Vice President of Kenya under President Kibaki; And
AGGREY AWORI (b. 1939) former MP, Minister for ICT &amp; former Presidential Candidate in Uganda..!
The two brothers, from a family and clan that straddles across what was later to become the Uganda-Kenya border are sons of Rev. Canon Jeremiah Musungu Awori, a pioneer priest of what was then known as the Native Anglican Church (NAC) in East Africa, and his wife,
Mrs. Mariamu Odongo Awori, a nurse and community teacher. Rev. Canon Jeremiah Musungu Awori was son of Awori Khatamonga - a fabled elephant hunter who operated at the Uganda-Kenya border from the mid-1800s.
 At one time, the two brothers - Aggrey Awori &amp; Moody Awori were serving respectively in Uganda Cabinet and Kenya Cabinet; One was running for President in Uganda, the other became Kenya&#39;s Vice President.

There&#39;re many other similar cases, albeit less dramatic:
A classmate of mine at King&#39;s College, Budo, from Sebei, like many Ugandans, fled to Kenya, during Gen. Idi Amin&#39;s mayhem. On reaching Nairobi, he became a Kalenjin - President Moi&#39;s ethnic group..! Another friend of mine, from Karamoja, on completing studies in Mbale and Makerere University, went to Kenya and quickly became a Pokot - he&#39;s still serving in  Cabinet..!
Our own Hon. Dr. Chebrot, my classmate and former State Minister, was very much at home in Kenya, until opportunities improved in Uganda.

The same can be said of almost every borderline: The ITESO people, for instance, are to be found in &#39;Greater Teso&#39; of Uganda; But there is also a large community of ITESO people who inhabit Tororo and Busia areas; And across the border, in Kenya, we find a district called &#39;ITESO&#39; District mostly populated by the Iteso..!
Similarly: A large population of the ACHOLI people in South Sudan; the LUGBARA, ALUR, BATOORO/ BAHUMA &amp; several others, are also native in the Democratic Republic of Congo..!!
In Europe: Switzerland has four tribes: Germans, French and Italians and the Romanche;
Belgium has a large French tribe; Austria and Hungary, the Germans.

On Uganda&#39;s Southern Flank: The people of KARAGWE in Tanzania, are quite similar to the people of ANKOLE &amp; KOOKI (RAKAI District).
Still on south western border of Uganda, is RWANDA, with whom Uganda has had much interaction for centuries - in war and in peace. Consequently, many Runyankore/ Rukiga speaking communities were caught on the Rwanda side; and many Kinyarwanda speaking people were &#39;Demarcated&#39; inside Uganda, in addition to others, in Ntungamo, Rukiga, Kabale &amp; Kisoro, whose territories were adjusted and place inside Uganda, by European Agreements.
Former Rwanda President HABYARIMANA, for example, was a MUKIGA from Gisenyi, North-western Rwanda, bordering Kigezi.
To the North-East of Rwanda, is the Umutara province, where native Runyankore speaking cattle keeping (Bahima) of the Bagina, Bashambo and other clans were settled. Some of them - Kataraiha and Kisiribombo - were appointed by the Rwanda King as Superior Chiefs. Most of these Bahima communities remained in Rwanda until the 1990/ &#39;94 war.

iv) THE GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE ON ETHNIC RIVALRY And CONFLICT:
From the end of WWII in 1945 to the &#39;Fall of The Berlin Wall&#39; in 1989, Global Conflict was mostly driven by &#39;The Cold War&#39; between The USA and USSR.
But now all over the world, especially in the last 30 years, the world is at war with itself - Conflict mostly driven by Nationalist Extremism. Ethnic conflict has been cause of much suffering, war &amp; destruction.

Nationalism was principally responsible for starting both WWI &amp; WWII.
By 1900, the Austria-Hungary Empire was the largest and most powerful political entity in mainland Europe, holding together a dozen disparate ethnic communities, including: Germans, Hungarians, Polish, Czech, Ukrainians, Slovak, Slovene, Croatians, Serbs, Italians and the Romanians.
The Slovacs nationalists in Bosnia and Herzegovina, however, were no longer happy under the Austria-Hungary rule; they considered themselves Serbians, and preferred to have their territory ruled by their kith, in Serbia.
Over time, tensions rose. A Slovac terrorist assassinated an Austria-Hungarian Duke. Then war was launched: Austria declared war on Serbia, which quickly drew in Germany, Russia, Britain, France .. The rest is just history, of 10 million dead, 25 million maimed. And a Global Economy on its knees. ALL FOR TRIBAL/ Ethnic ANIMOSITIES...!!

Banyarwanda of Uganda are not alone..!!
Many countries seem to be struggling with nationalist sentiments. The world headlines are filled with Nationalist Conflicts, laden with Ethnic emotions:
Whether you look at Germany or France; the Uighur Muslims in China, the Political contests in South Sudan, the Rohingya Muslims of Myanmar. The world needs a considered response.

In the United Staes of America, &#39;Black Lives Matter&#39; is the Battle cry for African-Americans; and now Asian-Americans seem to be the immediate target. The world is aflame with tribal rage.

Personally, I think one of the most backward element included in our Constitution was the promotion of Ethnic loyalties - requiring even the most patriotic Ugandan to first identify with some tribal grouping..!!
A most unfortunate inclusion..!

Excerpts From Counsel EDGAR TABARO, son of Retired Justice Tabaro:

&quot;..  Early recorded migrations of Banyarwanda to Uganda in their hordes was at the beginning of the first decade of the 20th Century, when cash crop was introduced by Mitchel Cotts the successor to the Uganda Company (incorporated 1896) itself a successor to the Imperial British East Africa Company (IBEACO) that had a royal charter. The early migrants are mainly in areas of tea production in Namutamba and Tooro where they worked as wage earners although a good number took up other menial jobs in other counties of Buganda and their descendant continue to live.
In 1910, the Anglo - German – Belgian conference was held in Brussels,  which resulted in several agreements ...  between Belgium and Germany .. One, signed at Brussels, on May 14, 1910, settling the boundary between German East Africa and the Belgian Colony of the Congo. 
Another Signed at Brussels, August 11, 1910, further on a Protocol between Great Britain and Germany Describing the Frontier between the Uganda Protectorate and German East Africa. Finally confirmed, Signed at Kamwezi, October 30, 1911. 
Memorandum attached to the Protocol List of Boundary Pillars on the Anglo - German Boundary, Sabinio to River Chizingo, with approximate Co-ordinates.

These two legal documents transferred territories of Rwanda Kingdom Provinces of Bufumbira (present day Kisoro District), and Ndorwa (present day Kabale, Rubanda and Rukiga Districts), and areas of Ntungamo that were inhabited by native Banyarwanda communities.

 It is worth noting that these are the persons referred to as Banyarwanda, an the indigenous community of Uganda as per the 3rd Schedule to the Constitution, though the ones of Bufumbira (later) assumed the identity of Bafumbira.  
 For a long time under both colonial and post-colonial administrations in Uganda, the areas inhabited by the Banyarwanda communities did not benefit from any form of affirmative action, a result of which the community was heavily impoverished. 
Infact, it was a deliberate government policy to reserve the areas as a cheap source for labour for the plantations and other richer agricultural regions. However, over the years, descendants of these people, (through hard work and discipline) have been able to lift themselves out of the shackles of poverty and ignorance, which may not necessarily endear them to other communities, hence exacerbating their resentment.
To this end, the Constitution of the Republic of Uganda, the following persons shall be citizens of Uganda by birth—
 (a) Every person born in Uganda one of whose parents or grandparent/s is or was a member of any of the indigenous communities existing and residing within the borders of Ugandaas at the first day of February, 1926, and set out in the Third Schedule to this Constitution. 
Uganda’s indigenous communities as at February, 1 1926 which forms the date to the last border adjustment to the Protectorate of Uganda that transferred the Eastern Province to the Kenya Colony, which is now the Rift Valley up to Lake Rudolf (Turkana). 
This 1926 adjustment is at the centre of the conflict over Migingo Islands!

<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>What needs to happen to foster positive change in regard to research climate, culture and conduct in science, for intellectual honesty and integrity on all levels of scientific practice, as well as in society, to become the default for all undertakings?

I think the philosophy underpinning statistics must be addressed to foster positive change in regard to intellectual honesty and integrity of science. 

Two schools of philosophy exist in the world of statistical inference: Frequentist and Bayesian (1).

To those unfamiliar with these schools I’m 100% certain that your exposure to statistics has been Frequentist. And to those familiar with these schools, it is without a doubt to any of you that the chief reason Bayesian statistics are not routinely taught at most levels of education (including most doctoral programs at as prestigious an institution of Johns Hopkins) is because they are complex (2).

But what is universally understood about these two schools of statistical inference? Fundamentally, the frequentist school relies too heavily on any single study for statistical inference whereas the Bayesian school formalizes our prior beliefs, then formalizes a statistical interaction between the strength of those prior beliefs and the latest findings from the latest study, and then the prior beliefs are thereby updated.

Sounds complex? Yeah, that’s why they don’t teach these methods! And therein lies the problem (3). As a community, we have chosen the easy path of Frequentist statistics that relies exclusively on one study, arbitrary p-values, and all the machinations of the authors of that study including their rigor, their proneness to error, their sloppiness, and their integrity. The tough way of Bayesian statistics is always a community effort, codified in the Bayesian prior knowledge, which always tempers the new information from the new study.

A fraudster who understands Bayesian statistics and who also is aware that peer reviewers and the audience at large are all masters of Bayesian statistics will be preempted from committing fraud. This would mean that teaching Bayesian statistics per se would be a preemptive solution to fraud rather than a reactive one, something described by the Director of the Office of Science Quality and Integrity as the ideal solution (4).

On a conservative note, Frequentists have met Bayesian halfway using meta-analysis to pool inferences from several studies and to reach one unifying conclusion about our best estimate of an effect size and the degree of our uncertainty (or heterogeneity across studies). Perhaps if these frequentist methods were not restricted to advanced courses, then fraudsters may also realize that their individual efforts will be fraught if they differ substantively from the rest of the literature. In other words, a fraudster would be certain to be found out!

To conclude, I am pessimistic about the moral integrity of the individual scientist for reasons outlined in my previous two posts. But I’m optimistic about the collective integrity of science for reasons also outlined in my previous post, which today I formally christen “Bayesian inference.”

<div class="highlight-default notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>There are two outlooks to life. One is of the ascetic priest and involves self-denial of the innate pleasures derived from food, sex, and violence. The other is cut-throat and is marked by expenditure of energy on a worthy enemy, recuperated by way of the spoils of war, and an unquenchable lust for the next battle. 

One outlook is more likely to yield modern day “struggles” against mental health, obesity, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. The ascetic priest might win their several “battles” against our species-essence and achieve longevity following a consistent spiritual and physical life-course marked by self-denial. But their followers will often fall short of expectations in this metaphysical battle; thereby becoming anxious, guilty, and alas, both spiritually and physically ill.  

More inline with our innate predilections, the warriors outlook can be represented as the military school of life: that which doesn’t kill you makes you stronger. So the option any person or tribe or nation faces is simple: keep fighting..  or yield (to unnatural asceticism or to the enemy).

Between these two stark options one will find the marvelous delusions that civilized man has crafted. Pacifism, United Nations, World Trade Organization, War Crimes Tribunals, et cetera. We might then conclude that modern man is at risk of completely alienating himself from his essence, were it not for creative solutions that rescue him from despair — such as the Olympics, the World Cup, Boxing 🥊, the cult of exercise, or the depiction of violence in film and literature. The cult of Hero worship is the vestige of a species that coulda woulda shoulda been warrior-like, were it not for its frailty. Oh frailty, thy name is man! 

And so one may ask whether mans’ creative excuses achieve their cathartic purpose. Or whether they merely postpone the inevitable regression to our species essence, while making man more frail, diseased, and ill-suited for this purpose. But such are the questions one needs to ask to restore vitality and meaning to life. Only then might the taunting &amp; mocking of childhood make sense, and only then might the bullying and humiliating initiations rites in teenage &amp; fraternities find a context, and of course only then might the fierce competition amongst high school girls &amp; just as much between corporate be understood as a mere side-show — to the original cut-throat essence of the species. Participants in these “battles amongst lost sheep” most certainly will seek a priest or therapist or opium dealer at some point in their life. Without expending a sufficient amount of energy on overpowering a worthy enemy, the modern man hoards his energy and — because E=mc2 — locks it in as obesity. All the prescriptions of the ascetic priest (really perpetuating factors of disease if you think of it) — purging oneself of food, the moralization of sex, and the proposition of kindness as the highest virtue —  glorify hibernation. Increased life expectancy thus becomes the proof of progress. And thats how a life is put to complete waste.. in the pursuit of some ideal where there is no blood.

Using research methods to study science itself

11/30/22

Last week I suggested that we apply a scientific method of inquiry into the Open Science Recommendations so that we do not take our dear reproducibility activists at their own word. 

I had no clue that I was already dabbling in meta science. So it really is possible to actively engage in an endeavor without having a name or definition for it. And so the 93 minutes of the first Youtube video dedicated to the question “What is Metascience?” tells me that perhaps our time and effort here could have been spent on more practical issues. 

The crux of the 93 minute video is that metascience is research on research. That for me is enough. The object of interest is scientific research. And the investigators who do research on research are doing meta science. What methods do they employ? What is the epistemology? They should be in essence the same used in science including trials, experiments, statistical analyses of findings, inferences, and conclusions.

One discussant has a vision of meta science as being interdisciplinary, with no boundaries across science fields. While I will not discuss this in detail here, I am not at all optimistic of this proposal because in the real world funding and financing of science is key to its sustenance. And the proposed cross-disciplinary meta science is likely to remain an orphan since each science is sui generis — has its own unique set of issues, challenges, and most pressing questions — none of which is meta science. 

What research topic would I choose to address if I had unlimited means? I would choose to develop an automated methodology that generates a meta-analysis of each paper submitted for peer-review to tell us how the inferences from the meta-analysis look before and after the new study is incorporated into the scientific literature. I’d then ask the authors, reviewers, and journal editors to write a one-sentence speculation on what makes this study unique to the existing literature. 

Anyone familiar with Lancet, JAMA, and several top-tier medical journals knows that they already publish a brief  research-in-context panel (What was known before? What does this paper contribute? And what remains unknown?) (1). What I propose is quantitive and reported with a classic forest-plot 

My proposition would be embedded within existing research frameworks, modes of publication, and methods, and would only face opposition if it entailed extra effort for researchers. Hence, I envision this to be an automated process. The authors of the original science or the journal editors would only need to enter key items such as study outcome, risk factors, and outcome metrics. This would be original research but also placed in a broader context as research on research (i.e., meta-analysis and commentary).

Part I: 
I think a fundamental logical fallacy in “Big Sugar’s Secret Ally? Nutritionists” is to mistake cause with effect (1). The basic hypothesis of the article is that the 655% increase in prevalence of Americans with diabetes over the last 60 years is caused by an increase in consumption of sugar. 

However, the true causal relationship is that diabetes causes an increase in blood sugar levels, not the other way around wherein increased blood sugar levels (from dietary sources) increase likelihood of diabetes.

What causes diabetes? More specifically, what causes type-II diabetes (the epidemic kind)? The answer is an increased resistance to the effects of insulin, arising often from a change in body composition with more percent body fat than muscle. Adipose tissue is insulin resistant.

And the cause of increased body fat over the last 60 years is reduced physical activity and more or less sedentary life style amongst Americans of most ages. 

To say obesity is caused “by a lack of energy balance” is incontestable. The article correctly quotes the NIH in saying “in other words, by our taking in more calories than we expend.” But then the author reveals their bias by focusing on the “taking in more calories” and completely neglecting the “more than we expend.” Hence, the entire article focuses on how food may influence our body weight through their caloric content.”

But how about how increased activity and exercise may moderate our appetite and thus our calorie intake (2)? This question uncovers the authors biased question and article title. It blinds us to the cause of dietary intake, namely, the hormones and endorphins that regulate our appetite in the first place.

Modern persons at all the stages of life including childhood, teenage, young adulthood, middle life, and later life have drastically reduced outdoor activity. Many more more video games, increased indoor entertainment through television, sprawling of suburbs and reliance on cars for every mode of movement (from home to grocery store, to school, to work, etc.) and such pattern have increased exponentially over the last 60 years and are the fundamental problem. Sedentary people eat more than active ones. So dietary intake is an effect arising from physical inactivity. 

Of course the consequence of the logical fallacy discussed here is the focus on diet and nutrition instead of physical activity, lifestyle, and environmental engineering that may nudge individuals back to what their ancestors did: more physical activity for daily tasks. 


Part II:

My favorite example of a statistical fallacy comes from American politics but may as well apply to clinical studies. Over the last 40 years, the American senate has had either a majority democrat or republican representation. But by majority I mean 51% (majority party) vs. 49% (minority party) of the 100 senators, two from each state. Just today, with Georgia’s senate runoff election complete, the democrats hold 51 of the 100 senate seats (3). 

Those is the majority interpret this as the electoral mandate of the people who have chosen them over their rivals.

But when you subject this to statistical inference this is essentially not different from the toss of a coin or a random electoral event bearing absolutely no meaning. When you toss a coin 100 times (to elect the senators), that may count as a sample size of n=100. And the majority of 51% may count as p=0.51. The standard error is given by the square root of p(1-p)/n, 0.05. Thus such a slim majority is 51% (95% CI: 41.2%-60.8%).

Here we see that this isn’t statistically significantly different from the null-hypothesis from a coin toss (pure chance, luck) of 50%.

April 5, 1999

 Volume 51, No. 26


First person:

Reflections on an over-examined life: navel gazers unite!

It&#39;s high time someone gave us political recognition. Not that we&#39;d ever actually vote, of course. We&#39;re far too busy working through The Artist&#39;s Way to leave the apartment for anything other than brie and cigarettes. But we like the idea of voting. We like the idea that social change is but an election ballot away--and personal transformation is as easy as e-mail.

If television personality Ally McBeal and radio therapist Dr. Laura Schlessinger were inverse halves of the same brain, they would exemplify the mind of the Postmodern Navel Gazer: the gourmet cheese-loving, expensively educated, Gen-X individualists who spend our waking hours trying to have our pain and ease it too. Heads without bodies (with sporadic alcohol-induced reversals), we applaud Dr. Laura&#39;s self-help sound bites while at the same time empathizing with Ally&#39;s endless neuroses. Is this fuzz in my navel lint or inconsistency?

At least three assumptions characterize the navel gazing mentality as I understand it:

Assumption 1: You believe that desire is better than satiation and take steps to ensure that you always want that which you can never have. Happiness is not sexy. Longing is.
Assumption 2: You boast a nihilistic exterior yet secretly believe The Truth is out there. But you want X-Files Agent Scully to find it for you. She&#39;s not a poet and she&#39;s not emaciated, so she has more time and energy than you to do that sort of thing.
Assumption 3: You gravitate toward quick-fix solutions to complex psychological and social problems. This Minute Rice approach helps ensure that while you continue to self-destruct, you can relax in the belief that change is just around the bend--should you ever decide to get out of bed and look for it.
Take my friend Gwen as an example. Gwen worships Dr. Laura with religious intensity. Her bookshelf displays Ten Stupid Things Women Do to Mess Up Their Lives at one end and, to placate the feminists, Ten Stupid Things Men Do at the other. She listens faithfully to Dr. Laura&#39;s daily denunciations of codependence, moral indecision, working mothers and drug-puffing teens. &quot;Instant therapy,&quot; Gwen calls her show.

Of course, she never actually follows Dr. Laura&#39;s advice. That would be taking things to an extreme. No, Gwen is quite content remaining, like Ally, perpetually unhappy; she&#39;s addicted to The English Patient and to angst-ridden Ally McBeal list-servs. She complains of having lost her &quot;passion&quot; for religion. She repeats relational mistakes dozens of times, then spends Kleenex-filled evenings rereading old journals. How could she have time to pursue a healthy relationship, a spiritual life or meaningful work? Thousands of eighth grade diary pages are still waiting to be deconstructed!

Every so often I experience doubts about the implications of postmodern navel gazing. Periodically I wake to looming questions I would rather let Scully--or maybe a licensed ethicist--address. What are the moral, social and political consequences of an over-examined life? Can a person care responsibly for his or her &quot;self&quot; without becoming solipsistic and without abandoning responsibility to the common or public good? Does Generation X need an ethic of self-reflection?

One could argue, after all, that Dr. Laura&#39;s tactics for self-reflection are highly unethical. She interrupts working mothers with unjustified accusations of greed and selfishness. She applies careless verbal Band-Aids to gaping psychological and social wounds. She doesn&#39;t listen; she simply swoops in for the therapeutic kill.

One could also argue that Dr. Laura is as myopic as her waifish opposite. Ally&#39;s television show is a celebration of destructive behavior; Dr. Laura&#39;s radio show is a two-second &quot;solution&quot; to lifelong patterns of destructive behavior. Neither program bothers to distinguish between damaging versus constructive forms of self-examination. Neither pauses to consider the consequences of representing ethical and psychological lethargy as entertainment.

Thankfully, however, I have discovered that coffee and cigarettes provide an excellent antidote to such bothersome late-night misgivings. Armed with mug and cancer stick, I can proclaim to my rapt stuffed animals that while solipsism, social responsibility and myopic stagnation might be worth addressing, I personally do not have the time or luxury to look into any of them.

This is because I am busy perfecting my use of the navel gazer&#39;s favorite academic term: &quot;paradox.&quot; Paradox is a good word because it allows us to be as contradictory as possible without having to explain our actions or justify a lack of personal ethics. For example:

Question: &quot;But Stacia, how can you applaud Dr. Laura&#39;s absolutist moralistic tone while at the same time wallowing in Ally&#39;s haze of moral and personal ambiguity?&quot; Answer: &quot;It&#39;s a paradox!&quot;

See how handy the word is? Thank God for higher education.

Navel gazers, take heart: Contrary to what that awful therapist once told you, being pathologically unhappy or perpetually self-destructive is not a bad thing. Our supposed flaws are actually rare gifts: They not only provide poetic distraction from healthy relationships and from life&#39;s deepest questions, they also make terrific diet aids. Just look at Ally: She&#39;s so busy chewing on her own personal drama, her body has disappeared almost entirely.

Now that&#39;s what I call self-absorption.

12/21/22

Viagra was developed and studied in phase I clinical trials for hypertension and angina pectoris (1). It’s therapeutic effects were not substantive and did not reach phase II or III trials. But a commonly reported side effect in the phase I trial was the induction of marked penile erections (2).

Pfizer immediately recognized its commercial potential and patented it in 1996. It was then repositioned for erectile dysfunction and was approved for erectile dysfunction by FDA within a mere two years(3).

Within 3 months of FDA licensing in 1998 (4), Pfizer had earned $400m from viagra and over the next 20 years leading to expiry of its patent in 2020 the annual earnings from the sale of viagra were $1.2 - $2.0b, with a cumulative total of $27.6b as of 2020 (5).

The market for viagra and its competitors is expected to continue growing according to the WHO. Increased burden of lifestyle disease and sedentary lifestyle interact to cause erectile dysfunction. At a prevalence of 15% of the male population, it is projected by WHO to reach 320m persons by 2025 (6). Such is the story of an entirely serendipitous discovery by otherwise astute scientists and clinicians that were meticulous enough to profit from unintended consequences.

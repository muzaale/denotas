<p>Many Americans probably don’t know that a Pentecostal movement exists in France<br />
x<br />
Probably 90 percent of the attendees were black<br />
x<br />
The people danced, sang at the top of their lungs, and sometimes spoke in tongues. I never had the feeling I was witnessing a collective delirium, or that I was in the midst of a cult<br />
x<br />
The sign of peace, reduced in Catholic Masses to a brief, irritated, and icy shake of the hand, gave way here to interminable warm hugs and kisses. And at the end of the celebration, we would share bountiful meals.<br />
x<br />
And it was almost entirely a group of white people—I say that in order to establish that whenever we are ­dealing with affairs of the heart (and religion is such an affair, indeed of the highest degree), race is not ­pertinent</p>
<p>While I very much liked these charismatic celebrations, there remained in me a certain uneasiness, which I fully understood only later, thanks to Douglas Kennedy’s very good book, In God’s Country, which relates his study of revivalist Christianity in the Bible Belt. In reading the book, you sometimes get the impression that this renewal can only involve people with a past in alcoholism, drug addiction, prostitution, or homelessness—that it does not address itself to people who are integrated into society in a normal way, having spent their childhood in a reasonably loving family.</p>

Independently of the jolts and shocks of the epoch; that it will remain, subsist.

Latin was supposed to mark a difference between everyday language and the language with which we address the Creator<br />

<p>Hi Abi,<br />
 
Yes, I’m happy to assist with developing your search terms.  This is going to be a lot of work so I’ve asked my colleague, Stella, who is the Informationist for the Department of Surgery to work with me on this project.  She’s copied on this email.<br />
 
I think it will be best to have a group meeting so we understand the parameters of your search.<br />
 
Can you send us some dates and times you are available to meet? <br />
 
Lori<br />

Hi Lori – Xxx referred us to you and we hope you might be able to help us out, given your expertise.
 
We are embarking on a study that will query a large national database for certain generic drug names. We have a list of about 38 drug classes of interest to us (please see attachment), but the query will call for precise generic drug names. Is it at all possible to produce a catalog of the generic drug names under each drug class? Creating a comprehensive list of these drugs would be the first and, perhaps, most consequential step of this project. And so we thought it wise to consult an expert in these matters. 
 
Mara is the PI of this study and her primary appointment is with Epidemiology. It is for this reason that Donna referred us to you. Please let us know if anything needs clarification.
 
Thanks!
 
Abi

<p>What, if some day or night a demon were to steal after you into your loneliest loneliness and say to you: ‘This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain and every joy and every thought and sigh and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you, all in the same succession and sequence’ … Would you not throw yourself down and gnash your teeth and curse the demon who spoke thus? Or have you once experienced a tremendous moment when you would have answered him: ‘You are a god and never have I heard anything more divine.’ <a class="reference external" href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/52881/52881-h/52881-h.htm">The Gay Science, §341</a></p>

And the children in the apple-tree</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Centuries of husbandry, decades of diligent culling, the work of numerous hearts and hands, have gone into the hackling, sorting, and spinning of this tightly twisted yarn. Furthermore, we have not even to risk the adventure alone; for the heroes of all time have gone before us; the labyrinth is thoroughly known; we have only to follow the thread of the hero-path. And where we had thought to find an abomination, we shall find a god; where we had thought to slay another, we shall slay ourselves; where we had thought to travel outward, we shall come to the center of our own existence; and where we had thought to be alone, we shall be with all the world.</p>

<p>The Triumph of Bacchus</p>
<p>The time of youth indeed is sweet,<br />
But all too soon it slips away.<br />
If you’d be happy - don’t delay!<br />
Tomorrow’s ills we’ve yet to meet.<br />
Welcome Bacchus, Ariadne!<br />
An ardent couple, loving, fair.<br />
They spend as one their days with glee,<br />
For time flies fast and does not spare.<br />
Thus these nymphs - and others - fare.<br />
Happy they the livelong day!<br />
If you’d be happy - don’t delay!<br />
Tomorrow’s ills we’ve yet to meet.<br />
These nymphs are tickled by the thought<br />
To be deceived by lover’s wile.<br />
If Love’s sweet remedy were naught,<br />
Folk sure would be uncouth and vile.<br />
Commingled now, they dance and smile<br />
And sport and play the livelong day!<br />
If you’d be happy - don’t delay!<br />
Tomorrow’s ills we’ve yet to meet.<br />
Upon a donkey, corpulent,<br />
Silenus wends his weighty way.<br />
Heavy, drunk and senescent,<br />
Years and blubber on him lay.<br />
He can’t stand straight, he is quite bent -<br />
Yet still he smiles the livelong day!<br />
If you’d be happy - don’t delay!<br />
Tomorrow’s ills we’ve yet to meet.<br />
All ye lovers, boys, girls too -<br />
Long live Bacchus, and Love, I say.<br />
Play, dance, and sing, each one of you,<br />
Let sweetness o’er your hearts hold sway.<br />
Fatigue and weakness throw away,<br />
For what must be you cannot beat.<br />
If you’d be happy - don’t delay!<br />
Tomorrow’s ills we’ve yet to meet.</p>

<p>“What is it that Raphael did not paint? He painted no scene on the Mount of Olives, no Crucifixion. True, he painted a “Bearing of the Cross,” but it was a very poor picture and gives the impression of having been done to order. Neither did he paint any of the scenes leading directly to the Crucifixion. His creative genius begins to reveal itself again only when he portrays the figure of the great successor of John — the figure of Paul in “The School of Athens”; or when, passing over the other events in the life of Christ, he paints “The Transfiguration.” What Raphael has not painted helps us to understand that it was alien to him to portray those events on Earth (not events in the spiritual world) which took place after he was beheaded in his previous life. We realise why it was that Raphael painted fewer pictures of these particular events. When we look at the pictures, we feel that all those which portray events subsequent to the Beheading of John the Baptist, are not, like the others, born of earlier remembrances.”</p>

<p>Edgar Wind</p>

<p>the presence of unresolved residues of meaning is an obstacle to the enjoyment of art</p>
<p>x</p>
<p>These lectures were later compiled into a book, also entitled Art and Anarchy. In it he notes that, over time, public audiences have lost their capacity for an immediate and visceral response to art. The production and appreciation of art, he observes, has become marginalized and domesticated to a point where it can no longer significantly and lastingly move its addressees. Wind’s impulse in the piece is apparently restorative; he seeks to impede the observed tendency toward apathy and recover some of art’s latent anarchic quality</p>
<p>x</p>
<p>Wind begins his argument by presenting the long-standing conceptual correlation between art and forces of chaos or disorder, citing a lineage of thinkers and artists including Plato, Goethe, Baudelaire and Burckhardt. Particular emphasis is placed on Plato’s distrustful view of the imagination as fundamentally uncontrollable; Plato explicitly denied the true artist a place in his imagined ideal republic, not for lack of respect for the artist’s talent but out of fear for his capacity to upset the social balance. Wind also notes the repeated historical coincidence – in Greece at Plato’s time and in Italy during the Renaissance – of peaks in artistic accomplishment with political turmoil and breakdown</p>

<p>x</p>
<p>when art is removed to a zone of safety, it may still remain very good art indeed, and also very popular art, but its effect on our existence will vanish</p>
<p>x</p>
<p>Art has thus, according to Wind, moved to life’s periphery. Again, Wind notes that this distance carries with it certain benefits for the scholarly approach to art; “detachment brought freshness and breadth, and a freedom from prejudice, a willingness to explore the unfamiliar, even the repulsive, and to risk new adventures of sensibility.” At the same time, however, art has lost its ability to resonate at levels deeper than the intellect, to incite the passions. Engaging with a work of art has become an act of mere observation as opposed to “vital participation.” Art has, for Wind, gained interest at the expense of potency.</p>

<p>These days, the value of a firm lies as much in its reputation, its processes, the know-how of staff and relationships with customers and suppliers as in tangible assets. Putting an accounting value on these intangibles is notoriously tricky. By their nature, they have unclear boundaries. Not every dollar of r&amp;d or advertising spending can be ascribed to a well-defined asset, such as a brand or patent. That is in large part why, with a few exceptions, such spending is treated as a running cost, like rent or electricity.</p>

<p>At a time when a lot of us feel buffeted by a daily onslaught of grim news, 1843 takes you on a different journey. We cover the enduring stories of our age. Many of them have been around since The Economist, our sister publication, was founded in – you guessed it – 1843.</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>Hi Dorry — I wish to bring you up-to-speed with my GTPCI endeavors:</p>
<p>My 1st Term GPA was 2.50, weighted down mostly by two Cs (Biostats 651 and Intro to US healthcare systems). And my 2nd Term GPA was 3.11, weighted down by one C (Life Course Perspectives on Health). The GTPCI PhD program expects only A/B grades and a GPA&gt;3.0 and so my performance has been flagged.</p>
<p>I was mostly an A student during the MPH program and this recent performance is inconsistent with my track record. I’m happy to discuss what might have contributed to these recent Cs. But I’ll be having a discussion with Khalil some time next week regarding my plans to get back on track with the expectations of the GTPCI PhD.</p>
<p>Of course I got As for the GTPCI program requirements (Epi &amp; Biostats) during my MPH. The Cs I’ve received were for elective coursework, some of it tangentially relevant to my interests in Aging. I’ll keep you in the loop with what I discuss with Khalil next week and will also update you on what else I’ve been doing beyond the GTPCI efforts.</p>

<p>“A first, tentative example: at all times morality has aimed to “improve” men — this aim is above all what was called morality. Under the same word, however, the most divergent tendencies have been concealed. But “improvement” has meant both taming the beast called man, and breeding a particular kind of man. Such zoological concepts are required to express the realities — realities of which the typical “improver,” the priest, admittedly neither knows anything nor wants to know anything.</p>
<p>To call the taming of an animal its “improvement” sounds almost like a joke to our ears. Whoever knows what goes on in kennels doubts that dogs are “improved” there. They are weakened, they are made less harmful, and through the depressive effect of fear, through pain, through wounds, and through hunger, they become sickly beasts. It is no different with the tamed man whom the priest has “improved.” In the early Middle Ages, when the church was indeed, above all, a kennel, the most perfect specimens of the “blond beast” were hunted down everywhere; and the noble Teutons, for example, were “improved.” But how did such an “improved” Teuton look after he had been drawn into a monastery? Like a caricature of man, a miscarriage: he had become a “sinner,” he was stuck in a cage, tormented with all sorts of painful concepts. And there he lay, sick, miserable, hateful to himself, full of evil feelings against the impulses of his own life, full of suspicion against all that was still strong and happy. In short, a “Christian.”</p>
<p>Physiologically speaking: in the struggle with beasts, making them sick may be the only way to make them weak. The church understood this: it sickened and weakened man — and by so doing “improved” him.”</p>

<p>Shame on Freud: 1887</p>
<p>“What is the meaning of the conceptual opposites which I have introduced into aesthetics, Apollinian and Dionysian, both conceived as kinds of frenzy? The Apollinian frenzy excites the eye above all, so that it gains the power of vision. The painter, the sculptor, the epic poet are visionaries par excellence. In the Dionysian state, on the other hand, the whole affective system is excited and enhanced: so that it discharges all its means of expression at once and drives forth simultaneously the power of representation, imitation, transfiguration, transformation, and every kind of mimicking and acting. The essential feature here remains the ease of metamorphosis, the inability not to react (similar to certain hysterical types who also, upon any suggestion, enter into any role). It is impossible for the Dionysian type not to understand any suggestion; he does not overlook any sign of an affect; he possesses the instinct of understanding and guessing in the highest degree, just as he commands the art of communication in the highest degree. He enters into any skin, into any affect: he constantly transforms himself.” .</p>

Like in Molier’s 1670 play Le bourgeois gentilhomme, when Mr. Jourdain is surprised and delighted to learn that he has been speaking prose all his life without knowing it, many scientists such as Richard Feynman and Stephen Hawking are practicing philosophy without knowing. They discourse on ontology (the nature of things), epistemology (the nature of knowledge), identity, change, causality, necessity and the entire range of issues that one might rightly describe as metaphysics. 

Einstein, in a lecture delivered to the Nordic Assembly of Naturalists at Gothenburg, in lieu of his Nobel Lecture on the photoelectric effect, states the following at the outset:

“If we consider that part of the theory of relative which may nowadays in a sense be regarded as bona fide scientific knowledge, we note two aspects which have a major bearing on this theory. The whole development of the theory turns on the question of whether there are physically preferred stats of motion in Nature (physical relativity problem). Also, concepts and distinctions are only admissible to the extent that observable facts cam be assigned to them without ambiguity (stipulation that concepts and distinctions should have meaning). This postulate, pertaining to epistemology, proves to be of fundamental importance.“ (1)

The prominent Einstein consciously practiced philosophy, explicitly conducted thought experiments, brought the rigor of metaphysics to bear upon untenable assumptions that had dogged the world of classical physics since the time of Newton, and set off a scientific and technological revolution that is still in its infancy today. Technology is still playing “catchup” with the insights articulated by Einstein between 1905 and 1935. 

Such dependency between metaphysical concepts and empirical verification is not in any way opposed to Feyman’s conceptualization of the scientific enterprise: postulates, precise predictions, verification (or failure), revision of the postulates, etc. In my final project on the revolution of Organ Transplantation, the “concept” of replacing a failed human organ with a functioning one from an animal, identical twin, full-sibling, parent, or non-biological relative started just as that — a concept. How identical the allograft has to be to the recipient, such as with regard to HLA-DR and immunogenetics, is a matter of metaphysics. Whether such HLA-identity is necessary. Whether such an allograft will survive for a few days or more. Whether the immune rejection of the organ is an ontological fact, or whether it can be changed by immunosuppressive therapy. Whether one can find a donor with identical HLA (i.e., what we now know epistemologically as “neccessary” through tissue typing vs. identical twin in our earlier, more naive epistemology). All these are metaphysical questions the field of transplant grappled with in its early days and still does today. Whether or not transplant professionals are aware they are prating philosophy is one thing. But the fact is that they are. 

A conscious recognition of this fact may give science the sort of impetus and razor-focus that Einstein had. Maybe the slow progress of science is symptomatic of the neglect of philosophy among prominent modern scientists. We find ourselves “reinventing the wheel“ of metaphysics, unwittingly, like Mr. Jourdain.

<p>“The earth has been a madhouse”, he says in the Genealogy of Morals, and otherworldly philosophers, along with priests, theologians, and others, have played a large a part in making it so. Such claims demand rigorous scrutiny, so it’s pleasing that in the book under review Nietzsche’s account of ressentiment is carefully investigated and diligently analyzed.</p>

<p>“By your patience, Aunchient Pistol. Fortune is painted blind, with a muffler afore his eyes, to signify to you that Fortune is blind; and she is painted also with a wheel, to signify to you, which is the moral of it, that she is turning, and inconstant, and mutability, and variation; and her foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone, which rolls, and rolls, and rolls. In good truth, the poet makes a most excellent description of it. Fortune is an excellent moral.”</p>

<p>Nietzsche in his book, Beyond Good and Evil makes this comment.
“The case is not different with Shakespeare, that marvelous Spanish-Moorish-Saxon synthesis of taste, over whom an ancient Athenian of the circle of Aeschylus would have half-killed himself with laughter or irritation: but we–accept precisely this wild motleyness, this medley of the most delicate, the most coarse, and the most artificial, with a secret confidence and cordiality; we enjoy it as a refinement of art reserved expressly for us, and allow ourselves to be as little disturbed by the repulsive fumes and the proximity of the English populace in which Shakespeare’s art and taste lives”</p>

<p>The only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely.</p>
<p>All art is quite useless</p>

<p>Can art teach us to love life very intensely? Or does it merely fuel life-denying ideals?</p>
<p>Well.. Tarantino is loving, living… successfully selling his ideals</p>

<p>Dostoevsky was accused of reading works by Belinsky, including the banned Letter to Gogol</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Art is Individualism, and Individualism is a disturbing and disintegrating force. Therein lies its immense value. For what it seeks to disturb is monotony of type, slavery of custom, tyranny of habit, and the reduction of man to the level of a machine<br />
— Oscar Wilde</p>
<p>Therein lies the error in art. For master-slave relationships — in a word, Power! — belongs to reality whereas art belongs to fantasy. So ones ca confidently forecast the winner!!</p>

<p>Who the hell is Tucker Carlson? And why should I care about him</p>

<p>The summary of life? One either is powerful or powerless. The powerless are resentful and and left to idealizing what life would be like if they could have their way — ie if they could <em>also</em> IMPOSE their values on others.</p>

<p>If you say you’ve read Nietzsche but have no recollection of moments at which you could only chuckle, gasp in horrific enlightenment, or marvel wherefore his energy comes, then we can’t confidently declare that you’ve understand him</p>

<p>Which was the best ever Brazil national football team?</p>
<p>Excess strength alone is the proof of strength</p>
<p>It was either the 1998 or the 2002 Brazil team. Because of many world-class attackers such as Ronaldinho Ronaldo Rivaldo Kaka and they had many great defenses and stars in the defense such as Cafu Roberto Carlos and dida And they dominated every team whether it be a exhibition match or World Cup final and it did it with smiles on their face that is the Brazilian team so I would say 2002</p>

<p><strong>Irreligiousness of Artists.</strong> —Homer is so much at home among his gods and is as a poet so good natured to them that he must have been profoundly irreligious. That which was brought to him by the popular faith—a mean, crude and partially repulsive superstition—he dealt with as freely as the Sculptor with his clay, therefore with the same freedom that Æschylus and Aristophanes evinced and with which in later times the great artists of the renaissance, and also Shakespeare and Goethe, drew their pictures.</p>

<p>“When the English actually believe that they know “intuitively” what is good and evil, when they therefore suppose that they no longer require Christianity as the guarantee of morality, we merely witness the effects of the dominion of the Christian value judgment and an expression of the strength and depth of this dominion: such that the origin of English morality has been forgotten, such that the very conditional character of its right to existence is no longer felt. For the English, morality is not yet a problem.”</p>

<p>Tyler Perry is a self-made billionaire<br />
He understands what it takes to become<br />
Yet instead he creates preachy characters<br />
We are never seduced by any story of becoming<br />
At bottom of his film and TV one finds this failure</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Explains why artist seduce millions of folks
May even seduce one into a relationship<br />
But because a relationship is about becoming,<br />
And art about magic, illusions, genius beings—<br />
The man is found out and the relationship fails</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>When Paul Chelimo wins bronze for USA<br />
Is it an American process at work?<br />
Say openness to immigration ??</p>
<p>And when Marvell Jacob’s wins gold for Italy<br />
Does one celebrate an Italian process?<br />
Like intermarriage with an African-American?</p>
<p>But witness Italy win the men’s 100m x 4<br />
Lorenzo Patta, Marcell Jacobs, Eseosa Desalu<br />
Filippo Tortu — Only the Italian process counts!!</p>

<p>Hamlet is Shakespeare moralizing about all sorts of things<br />
There is really no action throughout the play<br />

As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,<br />
Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,<br />

<p>— While watching Gossip Girl —</p>
<p>Why do people like The Wire so much?</p>
<p>Because the true villain is the system</p>
<p>The Wire treated its audiences as intelligent people</p>
<p>When television history is written, little else will rival ‘The Wire.’</p>
<p>Because it resists typecasting. The vast majority of shows fit people into something of a mold, and usually into a binary set of categories— hero vs. villain, smart vs. stupid, calculated vs. impulsive. The Wire doesn’t do that. Every significant character is multi-layered and complex. Their flaws and their virtues are gradually revealed through their actions rather than expressed in simple terms. Characters who are tragically flawed in some ways are prodigious in others. And the show does a phenomenal job of showing how most of those characters became who they were. That makes it maybe the most impressive TV series ever created.</p>

— insulin resistance vs multi-system regulation<br />
— demand (body) vs supply (diet, oxygen)<br />
— exercise is proportionately largest demand</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Impossible to exercise without eating, but possible to eat without exercising</p></li>
<li><p>Since use-disuse atrophy is a fact, no amount of good food can build muscle. Only exercise!</p></li>

Life is principally will-to-power or else discontent
Might makes right and there’s little need to explain
Let one defend their truth — their values — by war
A moral-stance will be judged rigorous or sloppy by time
Dysphoria as sure evidence of wrongness of ones philosophy
Self-medication with pharmacological or other distractions as symptom
Only an approach beyond good and evil recognizes these downstream symptoms as such
The philistine finds ugly meanings in beautiful things but the cultivated appreciate the genealogy of this morality
I’d hereby like to conclude that this brings Dostoevsky, Shakespeare, Wilde, Nietzsche, and Yours truly into marvelous fellowship

Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen-presenting cells that link innate and adaptive immunity and are critical for the induction of protective immune responses against pathogens

mRNA is processed by dendritic APCs, HIV (with its reverse transcript) infects CD4+ cells

Unlikely that “leaked” reverse transcriptase from CD4+ cells will cause mRNA in dendritic cells to incorporate the spike protein code into DNA

<p>Did this guy just say we are in “Pole Position” to let her go home? Hahaha!</p>
<p>Agreed — the blood in urine is probably just injury from the catheter… the tube for passing urine</p>
<p>Otherwise, I agree that she should go home. Someone over 93 should really be home because hospital is rarely a good   environment at that age. Let her be home with people she knows, family, etc.</p>

<p>1.Rejection of transplant surgery because I’m a mere “spectator”, “commentator” — I’m taking no risks!! I’m an “objective” armchair scholar, half-priest, half-satyr, Renan-scented, who reveals all that he lacks, where he lacks it! I have neither taste nor patience for this: this person with nothing to lose by doing… : Genealogy of morality, Essay 3, Paragraph 26</p>
<p>2.Embrace of sports medicine since it would allow me to be a tight-rope walker across several towers including orthopedic surgery, athletics, health, strength, culture, public health, gerontology and all the while serve as an antidote to the high priests of dietary nutrition who proselytize to the beef-eaters in the spirit of Sir Andrew.. : Twelfth Night</p>
<p>3.Question all the brooding arts and professions — Hamlet-like — in their lack of action. Fortinbras, Achilles, Rugby 🏉: that’s more to my liking. Raise the matter with the ministry of education and sports in its condescending approach to PE. Meanwhile, get contracts with Ravens, Orioles, Cranes, etc</p>

Pointers to the existence of God?

1.This isn’t subject to scientific inquiry 
2.It also commits the greatest human error 
3.Reality is turned on it’s head 

#1. Origin of an error
— First, an abstract concept is introduced (ie God)
— Second, human beings craving relief from a chaotic reality find comfort in this concept 
— The said human beings will go to pains to prove or support the concept 

#2. Where science differs 
— First, a concrete aspect of reality that our senses can detect is introduced (eg our eyes see light, our ears hear sound, our nose smells molecules, our tongue detects molecules, our other senses detect vibrations, heat, cold, etc) real stuff!! 
— Second, curious creatures called scientists document the impact of those external realities on their senses and attempt to reproduce this experience beyond their anecdotal experience (ie the trials are repeated across several observers) and statistical summary of the observations with a mean and variance is documented 
— Finally, the findings are submitted for peer-review to weed out abstract concepts, clarify errors in logic, and ensure reproducibility of findings 

As you can see, “God” isn’t subject to science

 Portrait of Friedrich Nietzsche by Munch
Friedrich Nietzsche by Edvard Munch. 1906. Thielska Gallerie, Sweden. Via Wikimedia.
Friedrich Nietzsche was one of the most important philosophers of the nineteenth century. Though often misinterpreted, his influence has been enormous. Like his compatriot Schopenhauer, he questioned the comfortable beliefs of the conservative bourgeoisie of his time. His writings have fascinated generations of readers, his style was exquisite, his ideas original. Bertrand Russell called him an aristocratic anarchist.

Nietzsche admired the Pre-Socratic philosophers and was sympathetic to the teachings of the Buddha. He formulated the concept of the overman or superman, of the eternal recurrence, of a Dionysian life of gaiety and heroism. For Nietzsche, Christianity was a failure because it promoted a slave-like mentality, and when he said God was dead, he meant it was the belief in God that was dead. He asked whether man was a mistake of God or God a mistake of man. He thought that spiritualizing sensuality as love represented a great triumph over Christianity. He despised the bourgeois “herd,” who loved the police more than their neighbor, and advocated a free life as the desirable state for great souls.

In a section of the Twilight of the Idols (1888) titled “Morality for physicians,” Nietzsche proclaimed that the sick man was a parasite of society and that when the meaning of life and the right to live had been lost it was indecent and contemptible for a man to “vegetate in cowardly dependence on physicians and machines.”2 He argued that death should be freely chosen and cheerfully accomplished, amid children and witnesses instead of the “wretched and revolting comedy that Christianity has made of the hour of death.” “Die at the right time,” preached the hero of Thus Spoke Zarathustra (1883) as he came down from the rarefied atmosphere of his mountain bearing his eagle and his serpent. Yet sadly and paradoxically, this was not what happened to him after his collapse in Turin, and he lingered for many years, bedridden and demented.

Nietzsche was born in 1844 near Leipzig in Saxony, Germany. He studied classical philology in Bonn and Leipzig, and at age twenty-four was the youngest person to ever be appointed to the chair of philology at the University of Basel (1869). He resigned from that position in 1879 for health reasons and completed most of his writing in the next decade in Switzerland and Italy. There he lived in increasing isolation, usually in a modest, coldly furnished room, his compositions strewn on the floor, an old trunk holding his only possessions of two shirts and a worn suit, and a tray displaying his numerous bottles of medications: chloral hydrate, opium, and barbiturates. Wrapped in his overcoat, his double glasses close to the paper, he wrote for hours, depressed, in pain, increasingly blind, and isolated.1

We learn from “Nietzsche: in Illness and in Health” by William Gass that Nietzsche had been troubled by ill health most of his life.2 He had hemorrhoids and suffered from “gastric spasms.” He had bad eyesight, often fainted, had fits, and was scared of lightning, which made him hide under the covers. He sometimes vomited blood, for which he was given quinine. He followed prescribed diets seriously, ate only small pieces of meat with Carlsbad fruit salts, but changed his diets and physicians frequently. In the morning he had “his rectum flushed out with cold water.” He was treated with leeches applied to his ears, and these apparently partook of his blood while he partook of his wine.2 

Nietzsche had suffered from migraines since he was nine years old. These were recurrent, severe, not preceded by auras, mostly localized to the right side, and often lasted several hours or even days.3 Visual problems began at age twelve, when he complained of tired eyes, and later of diminished vision. Later he was found to be blind in the right eye, and by 1878 he was almost completely blind. Depressive symptoms with suicidal ideas first appeared in 1882, followed by visual hallucinations (1884). The final breakdown occurred in Turin in 1889. There are several versions of this story, the most common being that he saw a man flogging his horse, rushed to him to stop him, collapsed, and was found hanging onto the horse’s neck.

He was taken to a psychiatric clinic or asylum in Basel, where general paresis of the insane, quaternary neurosyphilis, was diagnosed. For the next decade, he remained in a bedridden vegetative state, insane and at times unmanageable. He had a series of strokes leading to impaired speech, facial paresis, and later a left-sided hemiplegia. He was cared for by his proto-fascist sister, who returned from South America and elaborated aspects of his philosophy that he had never expounded. He died in 1900 from pneumonia.

It had long been thought that Nietzsche had suffered from neurosyphilis, general paresis of the insane, but several authorities have now disputed this diagnosis.3-6 Interestingly, the asymmetry of his pupils, an important sign of neurosyphilis, had been noted forty years earlier but was assumed to be a new finding. Other proposed causes of Nietzsche’s disease are meningioma, bipolar affective disorder followed by vascular dementia, a hereditary form of frontotemporal dementia, or mitochondrial encephalomyopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS), a disease presenting with stroke-like episodes, epilepsy, and neurologic deficits.4,5

In 2008 neurologists from Ghent in Belgium carried out an extensive and meticulous review of original medical notes and other documents, mostly in German, and renewed their opinion that the clinical picture was not consistent with neurosyphilis. Instead, they proposed that Nietzsche had suffered the newly described neurological syndrome of cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy or CADASIL.3 This inherited disease of blood vessels has been found to affect mainly the blood vessels supplying the white matter of the brain. In support of their diagnosis, they pointed out that Nietzsche’s father Ludwig had suffered from an illness running a similar course, with aphasia, multiple strokes, and dementia, becoming incapacitated and dying at age forty-six from “brain softening.” One younger brother also had migraines, suggesting this was a hereditary disease.3

Still, the cause of Nietzsche’s death remains uncertain. It has been suggested that it could be established by an exhumation of the body and DNA testing on tissue and looking for skull imprints that would confirm the presence of a tumor.6 Some authors still favor an atypical form of syphilis as the most likely diagnosis.6 When all is said and done we may never know what killed this remarkable person. But more than a century later people still read him, and academicians argue about what he really meant. And for most of his readers, he remains stimulating, controversial, provocative, and fun to read.
